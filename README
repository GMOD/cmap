Comparative Maps - README

INTRODUCTION

These files represent a web-based application for graphically
comparing genomic maps.  It was originally written for the Gramene
comparative mapping website (http://www.gramene.org/) under the
supervision of Dr. Lincoln Stein at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories
for comparing across species of crop grasses (rice, wheat, oat,
barley, sorghum, etc.).  The project now falls under the rubrik of the
Generic Model Organism Database (http://www.gmod.org/).  As a project
funded by public money and written using freely available, open-source
tools, it has always been a primary goal to release this code for the
benefit of other genomic communities to help their efforts to draw
correlations between different mapping studies across a variety of
species.

The application is written entirely in Perl and takes advantage of
Apache's embedded Perl technology, mod_perl.  The application also
relies upon a relational database management system (RDBMS), such as
Oracle or MySQL for gathering the data, and uses Paul Boutell's libgd
c library and Lincoln Stein's GD Perl module to draw the maps.

To install: Follow the directions in the file called "INSTALL."

If you want to understant the code further, esp. to customize or
extend it, read "docs/CODE_OVERVIEW."

If you have questions, write the CMAP development list at
"gmod-cmap@lists.sourceforge.net" or the author at "kclark@cshl.org".
