CMap is a web-based application for graphically comparing genomic
maps.  It was originally written for the Gramene project
(http://www.gramene.org/) under the supervision of Drs. Lincoln Stein
and Doreen Ware at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories for comparing crop
grasses (rice, wheat, oat, barley, sorghum, etc.).  CMap was then
altered to be able to handle more types of data than just plants and
was subsequently incorporated into the Generic Model Organism Database
toolkit (http://www.gmod.org/).

The application is written entirely in Perl and takes advantage of
Apache's embedded Perl technology, mod_perl.  The application also
relies upon a relational database management system (RDBMS), such as
Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL or Sybase for gathering the data, and uses
Paul Boutell's libgd c library and Lincoln Stein's GD Perl module to
draw the maps.

To install, follow the directions in the file called "INSTALL."

If you want to understand the code further, esp. to customize or
extend it, read "docs/CODE_OVERVIEW."

To understand how to load and curate data as well as how to generally
administrate CMap, please read "docs/ADMINISTRATION."

For a guided tour of setting up maps and features and such, use a web
browser to view the tutorial in "docs/admintut."

If you have questions, write the CMap development list at
"gmod-cmap@lists.sourceforge.net" or the author at "kclark@cshl.org".
