CMap is a web-based application for graphically comparing genomic
maps.  It was originally written for the Gramene project
(http://www.gramene.org/) under the supervision of Drs. Lincoln Stein
and Doreen Ware at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories for comparing crop
grasses (rice, wheat, oat, barley, sorghum, etc.).  CMap was then
altered to be able to handle more types of data than just plants and
was subsequently incorporated into the Generic Model Organism Database
toolkit (http://www.gmod.org/).

The application is written entirely in Perl.  The application also
relies upon a relational database management system (RDBMS), such as
Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL or Sybase for gathering the data, and uses
Paul Boutell's libgd c library and Lincoln Stein's GD Perl module to
draw the maps.  CMap can also create SVG.

To verify the integrity of the tarball, run "cpansign -v" (if you have
installed GnuPG and Module::Signature).

To install, follow the directions in the file called "INSTALL.pod."
You will probably want to use the "perldoc" application to view this
file (e.g. "perldoc INSTALL.pod").  After installation, this file will
exist in the "HTDOCS" directory you indicate as "INSTALL.html."

If you want to understand the code further, especially to customize or
extend it, read "docs/CODE_OVERVIEW.pod."

To understand how to load and curate data as well as how to generally
administrate CMap, please read "docs/ADMINISTRATION.pod."

If you have questions, write the CMap development list at
"gmod-cmap@lists.sourceforge.net" or the author at "kclark@cshl.org".
