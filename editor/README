This document describes how to get the CMap application (that will become an
editor) running.

Currently, the application has very little functionality.

1. Add the table in editor_tables.sql to the CMap database.
    - This will add a table to link a feature to a map.  This identifies the
      feature and map as the same entity.

2. Load data
    - To best utilize the editor, load maps as features on other maps.
    - See the file editor_test_data for an example.

3. Populate the cmap_map_to_feature table with connections between features
that are also maps.  
    - Currently, this has to be done manually in the database.  
    - Example sql:
        insert into cmap_map_to_feature 
            (map_id,map_acc,feature_id,feature_acc) 
            select m.map_id, 
                m.map_acc, 
                f.feature_id, 
                f.feature_acc 
            from cmap_map m, 
                cmap_feature f 
            where m.map_name=f.feature_name;

4. Run the launch_editor.pl to launch the editor.  Supply a CMap data source or
it will use the default.

    $ ./launch_editor.pl [data_source]
