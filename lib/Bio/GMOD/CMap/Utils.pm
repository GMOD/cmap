This module contains a couple of general-purpose routines, all of
which are exported by default.

Given a reference to some columns, figure out where something can be inserted.

sub next_number {

=head2 next_number

A generic routine for retrieving (and possibly setting) the next
number for an ID field in a table.  Given a table "foo," the
expected ID field would be "foo_id," but this isn't always the case.
Therefore, "id_field" tells us what field to look at.  Basically, we
look to see if there's an entry in the "next_number" table.  If not
we do a MAX on the ID field given (or ascertained).  Either way, the
"next_number" table gets told what the next number will be (on the
next call), and we pass back what is the next number this time.

So why not just use "auto_increment" (MySQL) or a "sequence"
(Oracle)?  Just to make sure that this stays completely portable.
By coding all this in Perl, I know that it will work with any
database (that supports ANSI-SQL, that is).
