                   Revision history for Bio::GMOD::CMap

0.05
-   Fixed bug in admin map view that showed all features and a 
    broken pager
-   Fixed bug in admin feature search that broke in Oracle because
    double quotes were used instead of single quotes
-   Fixed bad URL in admin home page that pointed to "/maps" instead
    of "/cmap"
-   Fixed bad HTML in admin feature create/edit templates that didn't
    show feature type because of a missing "</SELECT>"
-   Fixed SQL in matrix that actually caused a server error, which
    should never happen
-   Added missing "</HTML>" tags to templates "feature_search.tmpl,"
    "feature_detail.tmpl," and "error.tmpl"
-   Added "alternate_name" to SQL for feature search (was expected by
    interface but never returned by code)
-   Added appropriate ending to feature search template (was missing
    call to page object's "end_body" method, important for Gramene)
-   Fixed bug in admin when adding a feature correspondence (see bug
    #632053)
-   Fixed a bug that allowed a feature to extend beyond the current
    map range if it wanted to
-   Added "alternate_name" to SQL for feature correspondences table of
    the feature detail page (interface was expecting it)
-   Fixed misplaced angle brackets in feature search template
-   Changed order of options on admin feature edit page that made IE
    set the "is_landmark" option to "yes" when it wasn't originally set
-   Added back in "use DBI;" statement to main CMap.pm module to
    prevent "Can't call method..." errors
-   Fixed errors in loading SQL driver in data module
-   Got rid of "cmap_dump.pl" as that logic has been moved into
    cmap_admin.pl
-   Added a schema for PostgreSQL and started initial testing

0.04

-   Added "cmap_dump.pl" script to help dump CMAP tables as
    database-independent "INSERT" statements
-   Put dump of entire Gramene database on GMOD site
-   Fixed a bug where a feature's relative start/stop positions could
    return a value less than 0 or greater than 1, which could allow
    features to be drawn outside the bounds of a map
-   Fixed some bugs in admin templates where they weren't including
    the footer
-   Got rid of useless "help_footer" template
-   Added ability to tee the output of cmap_admin.pl actions to a log
    file in user's home directory
-   Fixed various import and correspondence routines to print so as to
    take advantage of log tee
-   Added IO::Tee dependency to Makefile and default perlstartup.pl
-   Moved "insert_correspondence" from Utils.pm into Admin.pm, added
    some logic to keep it from creating correspondences between
    relational maps
-   In jumbling around code, I had messed up some code that allowed
    automatic zooming of comparative maps when going to the
    "map_details" page
-   Made cmap_cache dir permissions '0700' on creation
-   Playing around with some ideas about automatic auditing of
    database changes.  Nothing implemented yet, but I'm considering a
    Bio::GMOD::CMap::DB class to inherit from DBI and override the "do"
    method.
-   Really cleaned up admin code for removing objects from the
    database, very important as I can't rely on referential integrity
    to do cascade deletes, dependency checking, etc.
-   Cleaned up code to handle catastrophic errors better (misplaced
    conf file, bad db connection info, bad template dir, etc.).
-   Improved POD in cmap_admin.pl
-   Improved INSTALL docs with feedback from beta testers

TODO

-   Change Makefile.PL to use install targets for copying files
    instead of doing it myself during the configuration process
-   Add automatic database audit trail
-   Add watermark to images ("CMAP" + $VERSION + Date + ???)
-   Allow dbxrefs and evidences to apply to more objects than just
    features and correspondences, respectively
-   Some indicator for when features are dropped out
-   Add reverse sort on columns in map_details
-   Make contextual help (use object names from local data)
-   Add a key to colors/shapes on maps
-   Allow end user to override map colors (maybe shapes, too?)
-   Allow clicking/zooming on comparative maps
-   Move all SQL into modules
-   Add buttons under maps for "delete," "flip," "details," "zoom in,"
    and "zoom out."  Most likely I'll try to use icons for each,
    respectively: "X," some sort of reciprocating arrows, "?," "+", 
    and "-".
-   Write some tests!
-   Keep up with features by feature_id instead of name so that a map
    that appears more than one doesn't think that some of its features
    are corresponding when they're not.
-   Add dropping of existing correspondences when not updated with new
    correspondence file (as data import does with maps/features) (?)
-   Create dummy data to include with distribution that is more
    complicated and much smaller than Gramene data, move raw Gramene
    data to web download only

BUGS

-   When relational maps have feature shapse that aren't directly on
    the map (like dumbells, I-beams, etc.), they collide with the map
    title which is written vertically beside the map.  Either I need to 
    move the title to a horizontal position above the map (which will
    make it like all the other maps) or I need to delay writing the title
    until after drawing all the features.
-   Matrix, you see zeros when you zoom in on map
-   Fix pager of features in admin/map_view

0.03

Moved all the code to the namespace Bio::GMOD::CMap as the tool
became a part of the Generic Model Organism Database project
(http://www.gmod.org/).  

-   Added importing of correspondences (before there was only
    name-based)
-   Made install use ExtUtils::MakeMaker for "real" installation
-   Fixed bug in distribution of feature labels
-   Added frames around map "slots"
-   Added zooming on comparative maps in "map_details" and flanking
    markers
-   Added database cross-references to features
-   Fixed collisions of map titles
-   Added more to INSTALL file, moved some parts to DATA_IMPORT
-   Added sample data from Gramene project, maybe I'll have some other
    datasets in the future?  I'd also like to add a dump from MySQL.
-   Added "I-beam" shape for drawing maps
-   Changed database as such:
    *   Allow a feature to have specific db cross-references:
        alter table cmap_feature add dbxref_name varchar(32);
        alter table cmap_feature add dbxref_url varchar(200);
    *   Change the name of the "how_to_draw" column (awkward)
        alter table cmap_map_type change column how_to_draw 
            shape varchar(12);
        alter table cmap_feature_type change column how_to_draw 
            shape varchar(12);
        alter table cmap_map_set change column how_to_draw 
            shape varchar(12);
-   Fixed problem with spacing of maps and long titles
-   Removed old CSHL::* namespace

0.02

Pretty much a complete rewrite of version 0.01.  Moved to the
namespace CSHL::CMap.  Much improved, but still pretty rough, esp. on
the installation and customization.

0.01  

The original version was called CSHL::ComparativeMaps as I developed
it for Cold Spring Harbor's Gramene project (http://www.gramene.org/).
It was pretty rough.  Be glad you aren't using it.
