                      Planned enhancements for CMap
    
                             $Revision: 1.14 $

-   Rewrite the tutorial
-   Add Gbrowse-style uploading of maps and features to place on existing 
    maps;  expand to allow querying of Gbrowse, Chado or Ensembl (per 
    Doreen)
-   Write more (post-installation) tests!  (Tests need to assume some
    data in the database, a working Apache installation, etc.)
-   Modify the object export so that it doesn't include the table ids.
