                      Planned enhancements for CMap
    
                             $Revision: 1.11 $

-   Add Gbrowse-style uploading of maps and features to place on existing 
    maps;  expand to allow querying of Gbrowse, Chado or Ensembl (per 
    Doreen)
-   Some indicator for when features are dropped out
-   Keep up with features better so that a map that appears more than
    one doesn't think that some of its features are corresponding when
    they're not
-   Write some (post-installation) tests!  (Tests need to assume some
    data in the database, a working Apache installation, etc.)
