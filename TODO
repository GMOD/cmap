                      Planned enhancements for CMap
    
                             $Revision: 1.2 $

-   Some indicator for when features are dropped out
-   Allow clicking/zooming on comparative maps
-   Add reverse sort on columns in map_details
-   Improve documentation for curators, make tutorial
-   Add buttons under maps for "delete," "flip," "zoom in," and "zoom
    out." Most likely I'll try to use icons for each, respectively: "X,"
    some sort of reciprocating arrows, "+", and "-".
-   Keep up with features better so that a map that appears more than
    one doesn't think that some of its features are corresponding when
    they're not
-   Possibly add "attributes" table a la Bio::DB::GFF for things like
    curator notes, dbxrefs, evidences, misc. extra data, multiple
    alternative names to features
-   Draw correspondence lines between features on the same map
    (currently they only go from one map to another)
-   Allow multiple map sets to be selected as the "reference" set
    when making correspondences, also allow curator to select target 
    sets
-   In admin tool, keep track of sets between which name-based
    correspondences have been determined so as to speed up loading
-   Allow curator to determine which features types are allowed for
    creating automated correspondences between
-   Make help more contextual (use object names from local data)
-   Add automatic database audit trail (perhaps use GMOD Chado
    mechanisms?)
-   Allow end user to override map colors (maybe shapes, too?)
-   Move all SQL into modules
-   Change Makefile.PL to use install targets for copying files
    instead of doing it myself during the configuration process
-   Write some (post-installation) tests!  (Tests need to assume some
    data in the database, a working Apache installation, etc.)
-   Add dropping of existing correspondences when not updated with new
    correspondence file (as data import does with maps/features) (?)
-   Create dummy data to include with distribution that is more
    complicated and much smaller than Gramene data, move raw Gramene
    data to web download only
-   Add "remarks" (and maybe "code") column to cmap_feature_type and
    cmap_evidence_type, allow clicking on description in map legend to
    go to a page describing the object
