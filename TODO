                      Planned enhancements for CMap
    
                             $Revision: 1.9 $

*   Remove tables "cmap_feature_type," "cmap_map_type,"
    "cmap_evidence_type," and "cmap_map_cache." The first three contain
    mostly drawing info that can be moved to "cmap.conf." The last can
    be absorbed by code and will eliminate unnecessary inserts and
    deletes at run-time.

    3 days
 
*   Change "cmap.conf" to Windows INI style to be compatible w/Gbrowse

    1-2 days

*   Refactor drawing code to make more modular/pluggable

    1-3 weeks

*   Add vertical (stacked) drawing of multiple maps from a set; allow
    restriction of maps selected by strings/regex's (e.g. "1-5, 6,
    A-C, ctg31*").

    1-3 days

*   Add Gbrowse-style uploading of maps and features to place on existing 
    maps;  expand to allow querying of Gbrowse, Chado or Ensembl (per 
    Doreen)

    2-4 weeks

*   Fix intra-map and intra-set correspondences

    1-2 weeks

*   Implement "zoom levels" to restrict drawing of feature glyphs by type

    2-3 weeks
 
*   Redesign viewer UI, allow for easier selection of maps

    1-2 weeks (+ ongoing)

*   Explore way to represent correspondences with fewer tables (which
    equals fewer joins, faster creation?)

    1-2 weeks
 
*   More expansive classification of feature types, incorporate SONG or
    DAG-representation (e.g., an "RFLP" is-a "marker")

    1 week

*   Update docs 

    1-3 weeks
