                      Planned enhancements for CMap
    
                             $Revision: 1.7 $

-   Better label distribution algorithm
-   Allow multiple alternate names for features
-   Some indicator for when features are dropped out
-   Allow clicking/zooming on comparative maps
-   Add reverse sort on columns in map_details
-   Allow some maps to be flipped by default (add "do_flip" option 
    in cmap_map?)
-   Keep up with features better so that a map that appears more than
    one doesn't think that some of its features are corresponding when
    they're not
-   Possibly add "attributes" table a la Bio::DB::GFF for things like
    curator notes, dbxrefs, evidences, misc. extra data, multiple
    alternative names to features
-   Make help more contextual (use object names from local data)
-   Add automatic database audit trail (perhaps use GMOD Chado
    mechanisms?)
-   Write some (post-installation) tests!  (Tests need to assume some
    data in the database, a working Apache installation, etc.)
-   SVG output
