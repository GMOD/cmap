                      Planned enhancements for CMap
    
                             $Revision: 1.3 $

-   Some indicator for when features are dropped out
-   Allow clicking/zooming on comparative maps
-   Add reverse sort on columns in map_details
-   Add buttons under maps for "delete," "flip," "zoom in," and "zoom
    out." Most likely I'll try to use icons for each, respectively: "X,"
    some sort of reciprocating arrows, "+", and "-".
-   Keep up with features better so that a map that appears more than
    one doesn't think that some of its features are corresponding when
    they're not
-   Possibly add "attributes" table a la Bio::DB::GFF for things like
    curator notes, dbxrefs, evidences, misc. extra data, multiple
    alternative names to features
-   Make help more contextual (use object names from local data)
-   Add automatic database audit trail (perhaps use GMOD Chado
    mechanisms?)
-   Write some (post-installation) tests!  (Tests need to assume some
    data in the database, a working Apache installation, etc.)
-   Add "remarks" (and maybe "code") column to cmap_feature_type and
    cmap_evidence_type, allow clicking on description in map legend to
    go to a page describing the object
