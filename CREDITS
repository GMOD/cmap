The following is a list of people I would like to thank for their assistance
in writing this code:

*   Doreen Ware, CSHL:  My boss at CSHL who continues to methodically
    explain to me all the biology

    and a constant source of bug reports and feature enhancements
*   Marie-Michele Cordonnier-Pratt, Aynsley Eastman, Bob Sullivan,
    Univ. of Geogia:  Great beta testers, esp. of the early
    installation process

    with Sybase
