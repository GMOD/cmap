The following is a list of people I would like to thank for their assistance
in writing this code:

*   Lincoln Stein, CSHL:  He hired me
*   Doreen Ware, CSHL:  My boss at CSHL who continues to methodically
    explain to me all the biology
*   Noel Yap, Cornell University:  The curator for the Gramene project
    and a constant source of bug reports and feature enhancements
*   Marie-Michele Cordonnier-Pratt, Aynsley Eastman, Bob Sullivan,
    Univ. of Geogia:  Great beta testers, esp. of the early
    installation process
*   Alex Li, Pioneer:  An early adopter of CMap and beta tester
*   Shu Li, NCGR:  Helped with many bug reports, first to use CMap
    with Sybase
*   Dave Matthews, Hugh Edwards, GrainGenes:  Enthusiastic users and
    source of lots of testing data
*   Ben Faga:  Finally someone else to work on the code with me
*   Everyone on the CMap mailing list who send in bug reports, fixes and 
    feature requests.  With your help CMap keeps getting better.
*   Hee Shin Kim, David Hane, Dr. Arouna Woukeu, David Schibeci and Manuel 
    Ruiz for graciously installing the CMap 1.0 release candidate and 
    reporting on their experience.
