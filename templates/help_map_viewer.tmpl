<h3 id="map_sets">Maps and Map Sets</h3>
<p> 
  In CMap, a <b>map</b> is a linear array of interconnected
  features.  This could represent a single linkage group in the
  case of a genetic map, or a single contig for physical maps.
  Related maps are grouped into <b>map sets</b>.  Generally, these
  are the result of a particular study, such as the set of linkage
  groups produced by a genetic mapping study.  For more
  information about the map sets contained in the database, visit
  the <a href="map_set_info">Map Set Info</a> page.
</p>

<h3 id="ref_and_comp_maps">Reference and Comparative Maps</h3> 
<p> 
  To set up a comparison, a user first selects a reference map
  set, then a <b>reference map</b>.  This serves as the basis for
  any comparisons that the user chooses to make.  Once the
  reference map image has been rendered, the user is given the
  option to select one or two <b>comparative maps</b>.  These
  comparative maps may be added to both the left and the right of
  the reference map.  The user may keep adding additional maps for
  as long as valid comparisons are available.
</p>

<h3 id="features">Features and Feature Types</h3>
<p> 
  Any item that is positioned on a map is called a <b>feature</b>.
  The position may be either a point or an interval.  Different
  <b>feature types</b> are represented by different shapes (such
  as horizontal tick marks [for points], line intervals, boxes,
  arrows, etc.) or different colors.  For more information on any
  feature, click on it to view the corresponding <b>feature
  detail</b> page.
</p>

<h3 id="correspondences">Correspondences</h3>
<p>
  The lines that connect features on one map to features on
  another map denote <b>correspondences</b>.  These
  correspondences are assigned either automatically (based on
  feature name) or manually by the data curator to designate
  features on different maps that are equivalent in some manner.
  Different colors represent different <b>correspondence
  types</b>.

<h3 id="opt_menu">Advanced Options Menu</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>Draw Maps to Scale</dt>
  <dd>
    Draw the maps that have the same base units to scale with respect to 
    each other.  The base units must be defined as scalable in the config
    file.
  </dd>
  <dt>Clickable Image</dt>
  <dd>
    To increase render time for views that display a lot of features, you can
    choose not to have clickable features (which leaves the navigation buttons 
    intact) or to remove all clickable elements from the image.
  </dd>
  <dt>Menu Order of Comparative Maps</dt>
  <dd>
    Order the maps in the comparative map menu by their predefined order 
    (specified in the database) or by the number of correspondences.
  </dd>
  <dt>Ignore Image Map Sanity Check</dt>
  <dd>
    If an image has an insane number of clickable elements on it this can cause
    a browser (IE) to crash and increases transmission and render time.  When a 
    threshold of the number of elements on an image is crossed (the number 
    defined in the config file), CMap will disable all clickable elements and 
    print a warning.  The user can ignore this warning (at the user's peril).
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="map_image">Map Image</h2>
<p>
  Once a user has selected a reference map set and a reference
  map, it is immediately rendered as a map image.  By default, the
  entire length of the map is displayed.  At the top of the image
  is a box in which is printed the species, map set name, and map
  name as well as a combination of the following controls:
  <ul>
    <li><b>i</b>: View the info page for the map set</li>
    <li><b>?</b>: View the map details page for the map (for 
        &quot;relational&quot; maps, click directly on the map glyph
        for this action)
    </li>
    <li><b>X</b>: Delete the map set from the viewer</li>
    <li><b>x</b>: Delete the map from the viewer</li>
    <li><b>L</b>: Limit this slot on only this map</li>
    <li><b>F</b>: Flip the map</li>
    <li><b>UF</b>: Unflip the map</li>
    <li><b>M</b>: View the Matrix for this map.</li>
    <li><b>N</b>: Create a new map viewer with the map as the reference
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  A vertical scale bar indicates positions along the length of the
  map.  The distance measure (e.g., cM) being used is printed at
  the bottom of the scale bar.  Features are drawn at appropriate
  positions.  A legend for the various feature types shown on the
  map is printed at the bottom of the image.  Click on a feature
  label to view the <a href="help?section=feature_details">feature
  details</a> page for that feature.  
</p>
<p>
  <i>Note that not every feature may be labeled.</i> The drawing
  algorithm will try to fit as many labels as it can, until there
  is no more available space.  To see more labels, you may wish to
  increase the image size or decrease the font size.  You may also
  specify "Start" and "End" positions to zoom in to a particular
  region on the reference map.
</p>
<p>
  If two or more maps are being compared, each map will be drawn
  in a separate regions.  Adjacent maps will have correspondence
  lines that connect corresponding features.  The color of the
  line depends on the type of correspondence, indicated in the
  legend at the bottom of the map image.
</p>
<p>
  In the lower-right-hand corner is a watermark indicating the version
  of CMap used to draw the map.  This is also hyperlinked to the CMap
  homepage, 
  <a href="http://www.gmod.org/cmap">http://www.gmod.org/cmap</a>.
