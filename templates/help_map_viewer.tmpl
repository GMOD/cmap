<h2 id="concepts">CMap Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="map_sets">Maps and Map Sets</h3>
<p> 
  In CMap, a <b>map</b> is a linear array of interconnected
  features.  This could represent a single linkage group in the
  case of a genetic map, or a single contig for physical maps.
  Related maps are grouped into <b>map sets</b>.  Generally, these
  are the result of a particular study, such as the set of linkage
  groups produced by a genetic mapping study.  For more
  information about the map sets contained in the database, visit
  the <a href="[% url %]/map_set_info">Map Set Info</a> page.
</p>

<h3 id="ref_and_comp_maps">Reference and Comparative Maps</h3> 
<p> 
  To set up a comparison, a user first selects a reference map
  set, then a <b>reference map</b>.  This serves as the basis for
  any comparisons that the user chooses to make.  Once the
  reference map image has been rendered, the user is given the
  option to select one or two <b>comparative maps</b>.  These
  comparative maps may be added to both the left and the right of
  the reference map.  The user may keep adding additional maps for
  as long as valid comparisons are available.
</p>

<h3 id="features">Features and Feature Types</h3>
<p> 
  Any item that is positioned on a map is called a <b>feature</b>.
  The position may be either a point or an interval.  Different
  <b>feature types</b> are represented by different shapes (such
  as horizontal tick marks [for points], line intervals, boxes,
  arrows, etc.) or different colors.  For more information on any
  feature, click on it to view the corresponding <b>feature
  detail</b> page.
</p>

<h3 id="correspondences">Correspondences</h3>
<p>
  The lines that connect features on one map to features on
  another map denote <b>correspondences</b>.  These
  correspondences are assigned either automatically (based on
  feature name) or manually by the data curator to designate
  features on different maps that are equivalent in some manner.
  Different colors represent different <b>correspondence
  types</b>.

<h2 id="options">Map Viewer Options</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Ref. Set</dt>
  <dd>
    Select a reference map set from the drop-down list. For
    descriptions of all the map sets, see the <a
    href="map_set_info">Map Set Info</a> page.  You must select a
    reference map set before any of the other options become
    available. <i>Note that selecting a new reference map set will
    reset all other map options.</i>
  </dd>
  <dt>Ref. Map</dt>
  <dd>
    Select a reference map from the drop-down list.  The list is
    limited to maps that are part of the selected map set.  You
    must first select a reference map set before this option
    becomes available.  Choosing a reference map allows other
    options to become available.
  </dd>
  <dt>Start</dt>
  <dd>
    Enter a position to begin drawing the map.  By default, the
    actual start position of the map is used.  Use this in
    conjuction with the &quot;End&quot; option below to zoom in to
    a particular region of the map.
  </dd>
  <dt>End</dt>
  <dd>
    Enter a position at which map drawing shall stop.  By default,
    is the actual end position of the map is used.  Use this in
    conjuction with the &quot;Start&quot; option above to zoom in
    to a particular region of the map.
  </dd>
  <dt>Highlight</dt>
  <dd>
    Enter features to highlight on the map.  Separate multiple
    features with commas or spaces.  If you wish to highlight a feature
    that has spaces in its name, then enclose the feature name in double
    quotes.
  </dd>
  <dt>Comp. Map (Right)</dt>
  <dd>
    Select a comparative map to add to the right of the map
    display.  Only maps which have some correspondence to the
    rightmost map are listed.  The number of correspondences is
    shown in square brackets.  <br> [See also &quot;Comp. Map
    (Left)&quot;.]
  </dd>
  <dt>Current Maps</dt>
  <dd>
    From top to bottom, lists the names of the maps currently
    being displayed from left to right.  To remove a map
    (including those exterior to it), click on &quot;Delete&quot;.
    The main reference map is denoted with &quot;(Ref.)&quot; and
    cannot be deleted.
  </dd>
  <dt>Comp. Map (Left)</dt>
  <dd>
    Select a comparative map to add to the left of the map
    display.  Only maps which have some correspondence to the
    leftmost map are listed.  The number of correspondences is
    shown in square brackets.  <br> [See also &quot;Comp. Map
    (Right)&quot;.]
  </dd>
  <dt>Image Size</dt>
  <dd>
    Select the desired size of the image.

      <li>
        <b>None</b>: Show no labels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Landmarks</b>: Show labels of features designated as
        landmarks or those with correspondences.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>All</b>: Show all labels that will fit in the image.
      </li>

  <dd>
    Allows you to collapse spanning features of the same type which 
    occupy the exact same coordinates as other features.
  </dd>
  <dt>Min. No. Correspondences</dt>
  <dd>
    Indicate an integer values of the minimum number of correspondences
    that a map must have to another map in order to be displayed.
  </dd>

<h2 id="map_image">Map Image</h2>
<p>
  Once a user has selected a reference map set and a reference
  map, it is immediately rendered as a map image.  By default, the
  entire length of the map is displayed.  At the top of the image
  is a box in which is printed the species, map set name, and map
  name as well as a combination of the following controls:
  <ul>
    <li><b>i</b>: View the info page for the map set</li>
    <li><b>?</b>: View the map details page for the map (for 
        &quot;relational&quot; maps, click directly on the map glyph
        for this action)
    </li>
    <li><b>X</b>: Delete the map from the viewer</li>
    <li><b>F</b>: Flip the map</li>
    <li><b>N</b>: Create a new map viewer with the map as the reference
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  A vertical scale bar indicates positions along the length of the
  map.  The distance measure (e.g., cM) being used is printed at
  the bottom of the scale bar.  Features are drawn at appropriate
  positions.  A legend for the various feature types shown on the
  map is printed at the bottom of the image.  Click on a feature
  label to view the <a href="help?section=feature_details">feature
  details</a> page for that feature.  
</p>
<p>
  <i>Note that not every feature may be labeled.</i> The drawing
  algorithm will try to fit as many labels as it can, until there
  is no more available space.  To see more labels, you may wish to
  increase the image size or decrease the font size.  You may also
  specify "Start" and "End" positions to zoom in to a particular
  region on the reference map.
</p>
<p>
  If two or more maps are being compared, each map will be drawn
  in a separate regions.  Adjacent maps will have correspondence
  lines that connect corresponding features.  The color of the
  line depends on the type of correspondence, indicated in the
  legend at the bottom of the map image.
</p>
<p>
  In the lower-right-hand corner is a watermark indicating the version
  of CMap used to draw the map.  This is also hyperlinked to the CMap
  homepage, 
  <a href="http://www.gmod.org/cmap">http://www.gmod.org/cmap</a>.
