    The Feature Search page allows a user to search for particular
    features.  Simply type in one or more names or accession IDs in the
    "Feature  Names" box, separating them with whitespace or commas.
</li>
<li>
    If the feature you are searching for has spaces in the name, then
    enclose the feature name in double quotes. You can use &quot;*&quot;
    or &quot;%&quot; as wildcards.  
</li>
<li>
    You may choose to search either the feature's primary name and aliases 
    or accession ID.

    Click on any of the hyperlinked column headers will resort the search
    by that column.

    If too many results are returned, then you will see several pages of
    results.  You can navigate the results using the &quot;Previous&quot;
    and &quot;Next&quot; links or by providing on a specific page number.

    For each name found, all the maps on which they occur will be
    displayed.  Clicking on &quot;View On Map&quot; will take you to

    the &quot;Feature Details&quot; link will take you directly to the 
    detailed information on the feature.  You may also click on the map
