<h2>Feature Search Help</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    The Feature Search page allows a user to search for particular
    features.  Simply type in one or more names in the "Feature
    Names" box, separating them with whitespace or commas.  
</li>
<li>
    If the feature you are searching for has spaces in the name, then
    enclose the feature name in double quotes. You can use &quot;*&quot;
    or &quot;%&quot; as wildcards.  
</li>
<li>
    By default, both the feature name and alternate name fields will be
    searched, but this may be restricted to one or the other.  
</li>
<li>
    You can filter the results by species and by feature type.  
</li>
<li>
    Click on any of the hyperlinked column headers will resort the search
    by that column.  
</li>
<li>
    If too many results are returned, then you will see several pages of
    results.  You can navigate the results using the &quot;Previous&quot;
    and &quot;Next&quot; links or by providing on a specific page number.
</li>
<li>
    For each name found, all the maps on which they occur will be
    displayed.  Clicking on &quot;View On Map&quot; will take you to
    the map details page with the appropriate feature highlighted, and
    the &quot;Feature Details&quot; link will take you directly to the 
    detailed information on the feature.
</li>
</ul>
