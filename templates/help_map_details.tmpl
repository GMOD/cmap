<h2>Map Image/Controls</h2>
<p>
The map details page shows you a view of the map with most of the same map
controls as are present on the regular map viewer page.  While you
cannot select comparative maps to add to the view, you do continue to
see whichever maps were present on the right or left of the map in
detail when it was shown in the regular viewer.  There is also a link
to &quot;View Feature Details Table&quot; which will take you to a
table just below the image showing more information for the features
on the map.
</p>

<h2>Map Details Table</h2>
<p>
Just below the map image is a table detailing the map's type, set,
species, name, start and stop positions, and a breakdown of its
features by type.  You may click on the provided links to view more
info on the map type and map set as well as clicking on the feature
types to view the info on each.
</p>

<h2>Feature Details Table</h2>
<p>
Below the map details table, you will see a table describing every
feature present on the chosen map.  For each feature, you are shown
the primary name, its type, its position on the map, and all its
correspondences.  For each of the correspondences, you are shown the
species/map set/map, the corresponding feature's name and position,
the evidence supporting the correspondence, and a link to view the two
maps beside each other.  If the feature has no correspondences, then
<em>No other positions</em> will show in the &quot;Comparative
Maps&quot; column.  Click on any feature's name to see the feature
details page for it.
</p>

<p>
You can resort the feature detail table by any column header which is
hyperlinked.  Any feature highlighted in the map image should also be
highlighted in the table.
</p>

<p>
It is possible to restrict the maps which appear in the
&quot;Comparative Maps&quot; column by using the &quot;Restrict by
Map&quot; menu just above the table.  You can restrict by a single map
or by an entire map set.
</p>

<h2>Downloading Data</h2>
<p>
If you would like a dump of the entire map's features and
correspondences as a tab-delimited text file, then you can click on
the &quot;Download Feature Correspondence Data&quot; link.
To get just the raw feature data, click the &quot;Download Map
Data&quot; link.
