<h2>Map Type Infomation</h2>
<p>
This page displays each map type's map units, shape, width, and color.
Additionally, each map type is flagged as to whether or not it is 
considered by the curators as a &quot;relational only&quot; map, 
meaning that maps of this type can only be viewed <em>in relation
to</em> some reference map.
