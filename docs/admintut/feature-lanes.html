In addition to determing the glyph and color for feature types, you
can control how features are grouped, how they are placed in proximity
to the map, and the order in which they are drawn.  This grouping
(into &quot;lanes&quot;) and ordering (via &quot;priorities&quot;)
allows the curator to prioritize data so that the end user can better
discern patterns.

<h2>Lane</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">
      By default, all the features for a map are drawn as closely to the map
      as possible.  Here's an example of a rather dense map with all the
      features in the same lane (and at the same priority):
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">
      Here it is with the lines in the lane &quot;1&quot;, and the
      rest in lanes &quot;2.&quot;
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">
      And here it is with the each feature type in it's own lane (with
      the exception of the &quot;box,&quot; which shares the same lane as
      the &quot;line.&quot;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-cluttered.jpg">
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-uncluttered1.jpg">
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-uncluttered2.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Priority</h2>

How soon in the lane the feature is drawn.
