      Maps can either stand on their own or must be shown <em>in relation
      to</em> some other map.  The latter are called &quot;relational&quot;
      maps in CMap.  When a map set is tagged as having &quot;relational
      only&quot; maps, then this applies to all the maps in the set.  In
      order to view these relational maps, the user must first select some
      &quot;reference map&quot; which has correspondences to some of the
      relational maps.  The choice of exactly which maps are shown in the
      image is determined by CMap -- only maps with correspondences to the
      reference map are displayed.

      <p>
      Normally, all maps are drawn to the full height available in the
      image, like the map on the left in this image.  No effort is made
      to scale maps to one another, even if they are in the same map units
      (e.g., one &quot;centimorgan&quot; can represent different
      distances in different studies).  
      </p>
      <p>
      When a relational map is drawn next to a reference map, however,
      it is drawn to a length in pixels equal to the distance covered by
      all the correspondences on the reference map.  The contigs shown
      to the right demonstrate this.  In the cases of &quot;ctg2&quot;
      and &quot;ctg3,&quot; the tops and bottoms of the maps are equal
      (more or less) to the top and bottom positions of the
      correspondences. The other three contigs, have either just one
      correspondence or have all their correspondences clustered in one
      location on the reference map, so they are drawn to a minimum
      pixel height.
      </p>
      <p>
      The placement of features on the relational maps works just it
      does for any other map.  They are drawn at a location relative
      to their distance along the map -- that is, the entire pixel
      length of the map is assumed to represent the entire relational
      map, and features are placed at a pixel distance on the map
      equivalent to their start/stop positions divided by the overall
      length of the map.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can determine the shape, color and width of the maps in a
      relational map set just as you would any other map.

      As you zoom in, it follows that the relational maps will lengthen
      to accomodate the greater pixel distance covered by the
      correspondences, as illustrated in this image:

      However, this view of the <em>entire</em> reference map shows that
      our original view left off the furthest correspondence to map
      &quot;ctg3.&quot;  In this view, &quot;ctg3&quot; is far larger
      than &quot;ctg2&quot; whereas in the previous two views they were
      close to the same size.
