Maps can either stand on their own or must be shown <em>in relation
to</em> some other map.  The latter are called &quot;relational&quot;
maps in CMap.  When a map set is tagged as having &quot;relational
only&quot; maps, then all the maps in the set are tagged as such.  In
order to view them, the user must first select some &quot;reference
map&quot; which has correspondences to some of the relational maps.
The choice of exactly which maps are shown in the image is determined
by CMap -- only maps with correspondences to the reference map are
displayed.
</p>

<p>
Normally, all maps are drawn to the full height available in the
image.  No effort is made to somehow draw maps to a scale, even if
they are in the same map units (e.g., one &quot;centimorgan&quot; can
represent different distances in different studies).  When a
relational map is drawn next to a reference map, however, it is drawn
to a length in pixels equal to the distance covered by all the
correspondences on the reference map.  
</p>

<p>
You can determine the shape, color and width of the maps in a
relational map set just as you would any other map.
