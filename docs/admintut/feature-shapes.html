A feature's shape is determined by it's &quot;feature type.&quot;  All
features of the same type are drawn the same.  <em>Note: How your
features are drawn will differ slightly depending on whether you have
version 1.x or 2.x of <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">libgd</a>
installed.</em>

<h2>Shapes</h2>
These are the following shapes (AKA &quot;glyphs&quot;) you can choose
from:
<table width="500" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td width="80%" valign="top">
      <b>box:</b><p>This is an empty box which straddles the map (or
      lane -- <em>lanes</em> and <em>priorities</em> are covered in the
      <a href="feature-lanes.html">next section</a>). It's really only
      intended for the rare feature on a map which has a span (both a
      start and stop position) in the lowest numbered lane (i.e.
      <em>on</em> the map) which won't overlap other features with this
      shape, such as a centromere. Many features drawn with the
      &quot;box&quot; shape tend to clutter a map hopelessly. </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-box.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>dumbbell:</b><p>Like the dumbbell for the map shape, only you
      can't control the width. If the feature has only a start
      position, it will be drawn as just a dot (the end of the
      dumbbell). Here are several features drawn as the dumbbell.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-db.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>line:</b><p>This is the simplest shape as is ideal for
      single-point features. It is also a good choice for features with
      a span where you aren't concerned about showing the start and stop
      positions as the line is placed at the <em>midpoint</em> of the
      feature's span.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-line.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>span:</b><p>This feature is like rectangle missing a side
      where the open side point to the map on which the feature lives.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-span.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>up-arrow:</b><p>A vertical line with an arrowhead pointing to the top
      of the map.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-up-arrow.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>down-arrow:</b><p>A vertical line with an arrowhead pointing to the
      bottom of the map.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-down-arrow.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>double-arrow:</b><p>A vertical line with arrowheads at both ends.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-double-arrow.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>filled-box:</b><p>A black-trimmed rectangle filled with the
      color of choice.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-filled-box.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>in-triangle:</b><p>A single triangle pointing towards the map
      and placed at the feature's <em>start</em> position.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-in-triangle.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      <b>out-triangle:</b><p>A single triangle pointing away from
      map and placed at the feature's <em>start</em> position.
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/feature-out-triangle.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Color</h2>
You can use any of the same colors for the features as you can for
maps.
