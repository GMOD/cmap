<h1>CMap Admin Tutorial</h1>
<hr>
This document is meant to serve as a guide to the CMap
curator/administrator after the process of installing the software.
Here you will get a tour of how different options alter the looks of
the maps which are displayed to your users.  It is assumed that you
have read and understood the ADMINISTRATION document (included in the
&quot;docs&quot; directory of the CMap distribution) and that you have
imported some maps into your database.
