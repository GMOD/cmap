=head1 TITLE

CMap Administration and Data Curation

=head1 VERSION

$Revision: 1.4.2.4 $

This document is intended to help you understand how to use the data
curation tools provided with CMap.  There are three tools you will use:
the configuration files, the "cmap_admin.pl" command-line interface and 
the web-base administration interface.  

The configuration file is used to create and customize the look of map, 
feature and evidence types as well as customizing the CMap experience.  

The "cmap_admin.pl" program is used for all long-running processes that 
aren't practical to address over the HTTP protocol.  It employs a 
"wizard"-like approach to accomplishing various tasks by asking the 
curator a series of questions and performing the desired action using 
the answers provided.  

The web admin tool is meant to provide a point-and-click interface for 
performing the more mundane administrative tasks or for viewing the 
data. 

All of this is discussed in further detail in this document.

=head1 STARTING OUT

If you've just installed CMap, then your database is probably
completely empty.  (Of course, a small but complete dataset is
provided in the "data" directory, but the database for your own data
will be empty.)  So let's start by discussing what you need to do to
get a usable installation with your data.  This document assumes that
you've already been through all the steps described in the
INSTALL.pod document, so you should be able to pull up the web-based
admin tool by pointing your browser to
"http://your.host.name/cgi-bin/cmap/admin" (or where ever you have
installed it).  Depending on whether or not you decided to
password-protect that URL, you may have to enter a username and
password when prompted by your browser.

=head1 EDITING CONFIGURATION FILES 

The first step to getting your data into CMap is to correctly set up 
your configuration files.  The config files tell CMap how to access
your database.  Also, each map type, feature type and evidence type 
of the data that you will be installing needs to be defined in the 
configuration files.

CMap has multiple configuration files.  These files are read out of the 
"cmap.conf/" directory, likely located in your apache "conf/" directory.
There are two types of config files.  There is one (and only one) 
"global.conf" file that holds information applicable to all of the 
databases.  And in that directory, at least one individual configuration 
file for each database used.  Everything that can be customized about 
CMap is controlled by these files, which are described in detail 
below.

The configuration files are written in a standard Apache-style 
configuration file syntax.  Comments are defined as anything following 
a hash sign and are ignored.  Options which are grouped together are in 
angle brackets ("<>").  Standard options are written in a "Name Value" 
syntax where the two are separated by whitespace or an equal sign.  For 
more information on the syntax, read the POD for Config::General (by 
executing "perldoc Config::General" on your system).

Each configuration setting is documented in comments.  Legal and
default values are listed along with a brief description of the
option.  Except for the "database" settings, there is a reasonable 
default, hard coded value for every configuration setting (so you could 
actually comment out all of the "optional settings" in the file).

Whenever you make a change to cmap.conf, it will most likely be
necessary for you to purge the CMap cache to see the change if the 
change affects something in the viewer since.  This is particularly 
true if map|feature|evidence type information has been changed because
that information is cached along with database search results.  
Purging the query cache can be done by using the cmap_admin.pl program 
(explained later in this document).

=head2 global.conf

The global.conf contains information which is used by all of the other 
configurations.  You will want to set the default_db value.

=over 4

=item * template_dir

Automatically set to the path of the directory that contains the html
templates.

=item * cache_dir

Automatically set to the path of the directory that contains the 
temporary image files.  This has no relation to the query caching 
system mentioned earlier (that needs purging).

=item * default_db

Set the name of the database (named in its config file) that will 
be used as the default.

=back

=head2 INDIVIDUAL CONFIGURATION FILES

CMap supports multiple data sources and multiple customizations 
for each.  This allows a curator to maintain distinct databases 
and view them all in CMap.

If you have only one database, then you need only one configuration
file of this type.  Adding another is as simple as creating a new
configuration file.  Any file that is in the "cmap.conf/" directory 
that ends in ".conf" will be read as a configuration file.

The parameters are explained in comments but here some of the more 
important features are explained.

=head3 Main options

=over 4

=item * is_enabled

Set to 1 to enable and 0 to keep this configuration file from being 
used.

=item * <database>

Contains the database connection parameters. The 'name' field is the
name that this config file and the data source will be called.  
Therefor, it is important to keep it unique.

=item * expanded_correspondence_lookup

Set to 1.  This tells CMap if the database uses a normalized lookup 
table.  If you have used the upgrade scripts or the table creation 
scripts that come along with v0.13, you should leave this as 1.

=item * feature_default_display

Dictates the default choice of the feature type display menu.

=item * <scalable>

Dictates which map units can be used to scale maps to each other.  Maps 
with units described here will be scaled against maps with the same 
units.  

=item * <aggregated_correspondence_colors>

This option dictates the color of aggregated correspondence lines based on the
number of correspondences between the maps.  The default is black.

The format is "upper_bound color" where upper_bound is the cap that this color
is used for.  In the following example, from 0-1 corr, the line will be light
grey.  If there are 2 corr, the line will be blue.  From 3-5 (inclusive), the
line will be purple.  Anything ABOVE 20 will be black, which is denoted by an
upper_bound of 0 (in this case it means infinity).

 <aggregated_correspondence_colors>
    1    lightgrey
    2   blue
    5   purple
    20  red
    0    black
 </aggregated_correspondence_colors>

=item * <scale_conversion>

If you want to scale maps with different map units, the conversion factor must
be specified here.

For an example (a completely non-sensical example), lets pretend that a
centimorgan (cM) is 100 base pair (bp).  The config would look something like
the following, which is read 'One centimorgan is the size of 100 base pairs'. 

 <scale_conversion>
   <cM>
     bp 100
   </cM>
 </scale_conversion>

Since the directionality doesn't matter, this is the same as: 

 <scale_conversion>
   <bp>
     cM .01
   </bp>
 </scale_conversion>

There is no reason to define the conversion in both directions since only one factor will be used and it could create inconsistancies if one direction was different from the other.

Also, multiple conversions can be difined as in this (non-sensical) example.

 <scale_conversion>
   <bp>
     cM .01
     bands .1
   </bp>
   <cM>
     bands 10
   </cM>
 </scale_conversion>

It is appropriate to describe all relationships as CMap won't neccessarily figure out the relationship between a band and a centimorgan transitively (but it might depending on the order of the map sets).  Therefor, to avoid inconsistancies, please make sure to define all relationships (and define them correctly).

=item * disable_cache

Set to one if the query cache should not be used.  This is handy for 
speed testing or debugging.

=back

=head3 Map, Feature and Evidence Type Information

Starting with v0.13 map, feature and evidence types (*_types) are 
defined in the configuration files and not in the database.  This means
that to add an object of *_type, its type must be defined here in the
config file.

The accession id of the *_type is listed in two places for technical 
reasons.  It is important that both places have the same accession id.  
One is in the initial tag, <map_type X>, where 'X' is the accession. 
The other is in the 'evidence_type_accession' field.

It is important to note that some of the information is stored in the 
database when features and map sets are created.  Fields like map units 
and default_rank will not change in the database if you change them only
in the config file.  This may be something to be addressed in the future.

=head4 Common fields.

=over 4

=item * *_type_accession

The accession id that is used in the database to identify the type. 
No spaces are allowed.  Example: 'maize_marker'

=item * *_type 

The full name of that type, such as "Maize Marker".

=item * color 

The color of the object.

=item * attribute

Attributes of feature, evidence and map types have been moved out of the
database and into the config file.

Attributes are essentially name, value pairs which describe something about the
type.  They must be definined in <attribute> tags.  Here is an example entry:

 <attribute>
   name Description
   value This is the description of the *_type.
   is_public 1
 </attribute>
 <attribute>
   name History
   value This type was first discovered in the fourth century BC.
 </attribute>

Notice that is_public is optional.  If not given it will default to 1.

=item * xref (cross-reference)

Cross-references of feature, evidence and map types have been moved out of the
database and into the config file.

Cross-references (xrefs) are links from this type to another website.  They
consist of a name and a url.  If the url is inside the "cmap/" namespace you
can define just the end portion.  However if you want to link outside this
website, you must include the "http://".  Here is an example entry:

 <xref>
   name Map Search
   url map_search
 </xref>
 <xref>
   name google
   url http://www.google.com
 </xref>

=item * area_code (map and feature types only)

CMap now allows you to specify javascript to be included in the area box
over the drawings of map and features.  The following example makes the
map name appear in the status bar of the browser on mouse over.

$code=sprintf("onMouseOver=\"window.status='%s';return true\"",$map->{'map_name'});

This is Perl code that sets the value of $code to be the javascript 
command.  This evaluated for each map of this type which enables access
to the internal variable $map (or in the case of features, $feature).  

This allows the administrator the freedom of using javascript to make 
the page more versatile.

Some useful keys in $map (which are used $map->{'key'}):

=over 4

=item - map_name

=item - map_id

=item - accession_id 

The map accession id

=item - map_type_aid

The accession id of the map type (of course you already know this)

=back 

Some useful keys in $feature (which are used $feature->{'key'}):

=over 4

=item - feature_name

=item - feature_id

=item - accession_id 

The feature accession id

=item - feature_type_aid

The accession id of the feature type (of course you already know this)

=back 

=item * required_page_code (map and feature types only)

This field takes a list of page_code accessions.  Page_code is used 
to insert functions that map/feature javascript will use.  This is 
handy if multiple types do the same complex thing.  Creating page_code
is described later.

=item * extra_forms (map and feature types only)

This field takes a list of extra_form accessions.  Extra_forms are 
used to add form objects to the options menu.  These can be used for
anything from hidden fields that store data to buttons that submit
the page to a different place.  Creating extra_forms is described later.


=back

=head4 Feature type specific options

=over 4

=item * Shape: 

The shape to use when drawing the feature.  Here is a short
description of the shapes and what they're best used for:

=over 4

=item - line: 

This a horizontal line just wider than the map's width intended to
represent single-point features (e.g., SNPs or markers).  If the
feature has a length (a defined stop), the line is drawn at the =item
*midpoint* of the feature. This shape is the most generic and has the
least tendency to look busy on very crowded maps. It is mostly
intended to represent single-point features, but is also useful for
spanning features when you aren't necessarily concerned with showing
the span.

=item - in-triangle:

Like the "line," this is intended to represent single-point features
or just the beginning of a spanning feature (e.g., the beginning of an
insertion). "In" here means pointing at the map, which may mean
pointing right or left depending on the side of the map which features
are being drawn.

=item - out-triangle: 

Exactly like the "in-triangle," only pointing away from the map. These
two glyphs were added for the common representation of insertions and
deletions.

=item - box: 

Creates an open (unfilled) box that straddles the map. While it's
possible to place a box in a lane other than "1" (i.e., there's no
code in place to stop you), it really doesn't look very good.  This
shape was really intended just to represent infrequently occuring
features, like a centromere. The boxes get progressively larger as
they start to collide and are quite confusing when there are many. Use
sparingly.

=item - dumbbell: 

This is a spanning shape intended for features with both a start and
stop position. The dumbbell is fairly small and floats in mini-lanes
within the drawing lane. When a feature with no length (a single-point
feature) is drawn with a dumbbell, it renders as a dot (just the
circle on the end), which could be confusing to users.

=item - span: 

Like half a box, the "span" is a three-sided figure made of straight
lines that was intended for spanning features. Looks very odd when
applied to single-point feature.

=item - direction-arrow: 

Another spanning shape, this is a straight line with an arrowhead
pointing in the direction dictated by the 'direction' field. It 
"floats" like the dumbbell.

=item - up-arrow: 

Exactly like the "direction-arrow," only with the arrowhead always 
points towards the top of the image.

=item - down-arrow: 

Exactly like the "direction-arrow," only with the arrowhead always 
points towards the bottom of the image.

=item - double-arrow: 

Like the "up-arrow" and "down-arrow," except with arrowheads on both
ends.

=item - filled-box: 

Another spanning feature which floats (like the dumbbell), this is a
filled-in rectangle (trimmed in black).

=item - banding: 

A spanning feature where consecutive banding features alternate in 
color between black and the chosen color.  For best use set the
glyph_overlap to 1.

=item - read-depth: 

A spanning feature where the name of the feature dictates how far 
from the base position a line is drawn.  The name MUST be a number.
This will create a line graph type of glyph.  Set the glyph_overlap 
to 1.

=back

=item * glyph_overlap; 

When set to 1 it forces all glyphs of this feature_type into the same
drawing lane, allowing for overlaps.  This is important for the 
banding and read-depth glyphs. 

=item * Drawing Lane: 

A positive integer defining the "lane" where the feature will be
drawn. The idea was taken from Gbrowse's "tracks," this allows you the
ability to segregate feature types into visually distinct vertical
areas. Feature types which share the same lane will all be distributed
before feature types in the next highest lane. The lower the number
for the lane, the closer to the map the feature will be drawn.

Lanes are not absolute, they are only used to sort the features on
a map;  therefore, if you have only "Centromeres" and "Markers" in
lane #1, on any map with either of those types of features, they will
be drawn =item *on* the map;  on any map without those types, the
feature type with the next highest lane number will be drawn =item
*on* the map.  The same is true as you move into higher lanes;  if the
lanes move like "1," "4," "7," you will have only 3 lanes with no
gaps.

=item * Drawing Priority: 

A positive integer which determines the order in which feature types
within the lane are drawn. The lower the number for the priority, the
sooner the feature will be drawn in the lane.

=back

=head4 Evidence type specific options

A single correspondence can be supported by any number of evidence
types, so it is necessary that these be ranked from "1" to N (where
lower numbers have precedence over higher).  When multiple records
support a correspondence, only the highest ranking evidence will be
used when determining how to draw the correspondence line.  If you
intend to use cmap_admin.pl tool to create correspondences for you
based on simple name/feature type comparisons, you should create a
special evidence to use just for that purpose (e.g., with the name
"Automated name-based" or something similar to flag it as a
machine-created/non-curated correspondence).  Evidence type color 
will only be used when NOT aggregating.

=over 4

=item * Rank: 

The rank of the evidence relative to the others

=item * Line Style: 

How lines representing this evidence type will be drawn (not currently
supported)

=back

=head4 Map type specific options

=over 4

=item * Map Units: 

The units of measurement for this type of map.  This text will display
at the bottom of non-relational maps, so it's best to keep this short,
like "cM" for "centimorgans."

=item * Display Order: 

Like the same field in the "species" table, this determines the order
that maps of this type will be displayed, e.g., on Gramene it is
preferred that "Sequence" maps be listed before "Genetic" maps which
should come before "Physical" maps.

=item * Shape: 

This determines how maps of this type will be drawn. You can choose to
make maps of each type visually distinct by specifying different
shapes and colors. There are three choices for shape: box, dumbbell
and I-beam. A box will be trimmed in black and will be filled with the
color of your choice (or a reasonable default). A dumbbell or an
I-beam will be rendered only in the map's color (no trim).

=item * Width (opt.): 

How wide a map will be drawn.

=back

=head3 Javascript options

These options are only used to allow complex javascript to be specified 
in the config document.

=over 4

=item * page_code 

Each page_code has one field called "page_code" that takes in script 
information in plain text.  It is not as complicated as the area_code 
in map and feature types.  The example is javascript but it really can 
be anything recognized by your browser.  

This can be used to specify functions that the individual maps or 
features need to use.  When a feature or map type is used that requests 
a page_code object, the code is inserted at the top of the page.

=item * extra_form 

Similar to page_code, one or more extra_forms can be called from map or
feature types.  Each extra_form has one field called 'extra_form' which
takes standard html and will insert it into the main CMap viewer form. 
These can be used for anything from hidden fields that store data to 
buttons that submit the page to a different place.  

=back

=head2 INCLUDING CONFIGURATION FILES IN CONFIGURATION FILES

If there is a section of the individual configuration files that is 
repeated in multiple files, that section can be placed in a separate
file.  That file can then be included in each configuration file.

 <<include foo_type_info.cfg>>

It is recommended that any included files be named with a ".cfg" 
extension.  Do no name it with a ".conf" extension, otherwise it 
will be read as a separate config file.

=head1 WEB-ADMIN TOOL

The home page for the web-based CMap administration tool has links for
all the different actions you can take:

=over 4

=item *   Create New Map Set

=item *   View Map Sets

=item *   View Species

=item *   View Map Types

=item *   View Feature Types

=item *   View Correspondence Evidence Types

=item *   View Cross-References

=item *   Search for a Feature

=item *   View Color Palette

=item *   Exit to Map Viewer

=back

Each link is self-explanatory.  In addition to the above links, you
will also see the current data source to which you are connected.
You may configure CMap to connect to different distinct data sources
by having multiple configuration files; see the section 
L<EDITING CONFIGURATION FILES> above for more information on this.  
If you have configured more than one data source, you will also see a 
drop-down control allowing you to connect to a different data source.

On each "View" page, you have access to edit and delete the 
information there (except for map, feature and evidence type 
information which are defined in the config file).  Each page will 
be discussed in detail later.  For the moment, let's just focus on 
what you need to import your first data set.  To do that, you'll 
need to first set up the species.

=head1 SETTING UP SPECIES

Click on "View Species" from the home page of the web-admin tool.  As
you currently have no species to view, you should see the message "No
species to show."  To add a new species, click on the "Create New
Species" link at the top of the page.  You should now see a page
entitled "Species Create" with a form for the following fields:

=over 4

=item * Acc. ID (opt.): 

The accession ID

=item * Common Name: 
This is the non-scientific name of the species. This field will be
used most often as a prefix to the map names. If you plan on having
more than one species that could go by the same common name (e.g., two
species of "wheat"), you should differentiate them here, too.

=item * Full Name: 

This should be the full genus and species name for the species

=item * Display Order (opt.): 

This is the order in which you'd like this species to appear in
listings, e.g., on Gramene we prefer "rice" to appear before other
species as it is our model organism

=back

B<Note:> All the "accession_id" columns in the CMap tables act the
same.  They are all character fields, so they will accept any
combination of numbers and letters you care to use. Please don't use
spaces or characters outside the ranges "a-z," "A-Z," "0-9" or dashes
("-") as this will likely only cause you headaches. It is also not
necessary to explicitly assign any accession IDs.  While they *are*
required by the database, there is code in place to ensure that the
accession ID is set to the primary ID of the record if the accession
ID is empty. Once your accession IDs have been established and
publicized, they should never change.

The fields marked "(opt.)" do not require you to enter a value.  If
one is really required for the database (e.g., the "accession_id"),
then a reasonable default will be provided (e.g., the primary key
value for accession IDs).  When you are done, hit the "Submit" button.
If there are errors, they will be reported to you and you will have to
correct them before submitting again.  If there are no errors, your
entry will be accepted and you will be returned to the "Species View"
page.

B<Note:> On all the pages with clickable column headers, clicking on
the column names will resort the data by the column.

If you are unhappy with any of the data you see, you can click on the
"Edit" link of the record that displeases you and correct the faults.
If you have created an unnecessary species, you can delete it by
clicking on the "Delete" link.  After confirming that you really wish
to delete the species, it will be *permanently* removed from the
database.  

B<Note:> There is no "undo" function for deletes, so be sure whenever
you decide to remove an object from the database that you really mean
it. When an object has other objects that rely on it (e.g., species
records are linked to map sets), you will not be allowed to remove the
object until all dependencies to it are removed (e.g., no more map
sets use the species you want to remove).

Once you've set up all the species you wish to have in your database,
click on the "Home" link in the upper-left corner to return to the
web-admin home page.

B<Note:> Throughout the admin interface, the "create" and "edit" pages
for any object (e.g., species, map types, map sets, etc.) have the
same fields in the same order with the same restriction. If this
document only mentions the "create" or "edit" page for an object, rest
assured that the complementary page works the same as the one
described.

=head1 CREATING A NEW MAP SET

Once you have species set up and map types defined, you are ready to create a
new map set.  Everything in CMap is designed to be generic, so a "map
set" is simply a collection of maps.  What you group together is
entirely up to you.  On Gramene, map sets tend to correspond to
published studies of organisms and contain maps that represent
chromosomes, linkage groups, FPC contigs, and such.  As the database
design allows only one species and one map type to be linked to a map
set, it is best to keep these narrowly defined.

=head2 USING THE WEB ADMIN TOOL TO CREATE A MAP SET

To create a new map set, click on the "Create New Map Set" link from
the admin home page or from the "Map Sets View" page.  If you have
failed to set up species or map types, you will be prompted to do so
before continuing.  You will see the following fields:

=over 4

=item * Acc. ID (opt.): 

The accession ID

=item * Map Set Name: 

This is the canonical name for the map set. It is expected that this
name will be quite long and informative, e.g., "Cornell Avena
atlantica/A. hirtula RFLP 1995," but it doesn't have to be. Given this
expectation, the name that appears in this fields won't actually show
up all that often. Mostly, it will show up only on the "map set info"
page.

=item * Short Name: 

This is the short version of the map set name, e.g., "Cornell Diploid
1995" for the name above. This name is what will be used in all the
drop-down boxes and for the map titles on the images and in the
matrix. The field is limited to 30 characters.

=item * Species: 

This is the one (and only one) species with which the map set is
associated.

=item * Map Type: 

The type of maps that are contained in this set.  If there is nothing
in the menu, please make sure that map_types have been defined in 
the configuration file in use.

=item * Published On: 

The date on which the study was published. This is used to sort the
map sets. Most date formats will be understood and converted into the
proper format for your database.

=item * Display Order: 

The order in which you'd prefer this map set to sort above others.
Used before other sorting criteria.

=item * Is Enabled: 

Determines whether or not this map set will appear to end users. This
is intended as a convenient way to temporarily hide some data without
having to remove it entirely from the database.

=item * Can Be Reference Map: 

This determines whether or not the map of this map set can serve as
reference maps, i.e., as a starting point in a user's search, either
via the main map viewer or the feature search.

=item * Shape (opt.): 

The shape that maps of this set will be drawn.

=item * Width (opt.): 

The width that maps of this set will be drawn.

=item * Color (opt.): 

The color that maps of this set will be drawn.

=back

=head2 USING THE cmap_admin.pl TOOL TO CREATE A MAP SET

You can also create a new map set by using the "cmap_admin.pl" tool.
There are only a few functions that exists in both tools, and
this one was only added to cmap_admin.pl in order to make importing
new data sets more convenient.  You can only specify the species, map
type, long and short names, and accession ID for the map set.
Everything else about the map must be edited using the web admin tool.  

To create a new map set with cmap_admin.pl, start the script and
choose the "Create new map set" option.  Answer the questions
appropriately and confirm your decision.  If you see no errors, the
map set was successfully created.

B<Note:> When using cmap_admin.pl, questions which have only one
choice are automatically answered by the tool. In the above example,
if you had only one species in the database, cmap_admin.pl will not
ask you which species to associate with the new map set. There can
only be one answer, so it answers the question automatically.

=head2 VIEWING NEW MAP SET

Once you have successfully created a map set with the web admin tool,
you will be taken to the view of that map set.  You should see the
data that you entered and that the set currently has no maps
associated with it.  You can either create each map for the map set
individually or you can import the data for the map set.  Most likely,
you will want to do the latter, so that is the next section.

=head1 IMPORTING MAP DATA

Using the cmap_admin.pl, you can import a tab-delimited file
containing the data for a map set with the following fields and
data types:

=over 4

=item * map_name (character(64)) [REQUIRED]: 

The name of the map (AKA "linkage group," "chromosome," etc.).

=item * map_accession_id (character(20)): 

The accession ID of the map.

=item * map_display_order (integer): 

The order in which to display the map.

=item * map_start (double(8,2)): 

The start position of the map.

=item * map_stop (double(8,2)): 

The stop position of the map.

=item * feature_accession_id (character(20)): 

The accession ID of the feature.

=item * feature_name (character(32)) [REQUIRED]: 

The name of the feature.

=item * feature_alt_name (character(32)) [DEPRECATED]: 

The alternate name of the feature;  deprecated in lieu of
"feature_aliases" but still     supported.

=item * feature_aliases (character(255) each): 

Any number of comma-delimited aliases, each of which can be a maximum
of 255 characters

=item * feature_start (double(8,2)) [REQUIRED]: 

The starting position of the feature on the map.

=item * feature_stop (double(8,2)): 

The ending position of the feature on the map.

=item * feature_direction (double(8,2)) : 

The direction of the feature on the map, 1 or -1.  1 is default.

=item * feature_type_accession (character(32)) [REQUIRED]: 

The accession id of the feature's type.

=item * feature_dbxref_name (character(32)) [DEPRECATED]: 

The name of the database cross reference;  deprecated in favor of
"feature_attributes."

=item * feature_dbxref_url (character(200)) [DEPRECATED]: 

The URL of the database cross reference;  deprecated in favor of
"feature_attributes."

=item * feature_attributes: 

A semi-colon-delimited list of feature attributes.

=item * is_landmark ("1" or "0"): 

Whether or not the feature should be marked as a landmark feature
(allowing it to be labeled when a user chooses "Landmarks" for the
"Label Features" option).

=back

For a more thorough treatment of these fields, read the "import_tab" 
section of "perldoc Bio::GMOD::CMap::Admin::Import."

The first line of the file should be the tab-separated names of the
fields in whatever order you're supplying them (the order of fields is
not important).  You should use the above names for the fields, but
you can use spaces and capitalization for the column names, if you
like, as spaces will be converted to underscores and the names
lowercased (e.g. "Feature Alt Name" will become "feature_alt_name").

If the fields "map_start" and "map_stop" are not supplied, then the
start and stop positions of the map will be determined after importing
all the features by selecting the MIN and MAX start and stop positions
from the "cmap_feature" table.

Use the "cmap_admin.pl" script to bring in your correctly formatted
data.  Run the script, optionally passing your data file as an
argument, like so:

  $ cmap_admin.pl my_groovy_maps.dat

If you pass a file as an argument, you will be asked to confirm that
that is the file you want to use.  If you answer "no" or did not pass
a file, then you will be asked to locate the file containing your
data.  Type in the path to the file (noticing that you can use tab
completion), or type "q" to exit file selection and return to the
"Main Menu."  Once you've found your file, you'll need to tell the
tool which map set the data corresponds to.  First choose the map type
and then the species of the map set, then the map set itself.  Lastly,
you will need to confirm your choices.  If all goes well, you should
see a lot of lines fly by giving you the step-by-step progress, the
message "Done," and then you will be returned to the "Main Menu."  A
complete log of the actions taken by the script will be stored in a
file called "cmap_admin_log.X" (where "X" is an incrementing number).
See the docs on cmap_admin.pl (by typing "perldoc cmap_admin.pl") for
more info.

When you import data for an map set that already has data, all
existing maps and features with the same name as maps and features in
your data will be updated.  You also have the option of deleting any
data that isn't updated.  If you choose this "overwrite" option, any
of the pre-existing maps or features that aren't updated will be
deleted as it will be assumed that they are no longer present in the
dataset.  

While the import process is running, it may encounter feature types in
your data which do not exist in the database.  If this happens, the 
program will die right there and you will be left to the task of 
figuring out what was the last data inserted, defining the feature 
type in the config file and re-running the remaining data.

When cmap_admin.pl has successfully finished importing your map data,
you will be returned to the "Main Menu."  From here, choose to "Quit"
as the rest of the functionality will be covered later.

=head2 IMPORTING XML DATA (EXPERIMENTAL)

As of 0.10, CMap exports and imports data in XML format.  The standard
tab-delimited format is very convenient and easy to generate, but it's
also difficult to indicate hierarchical relationships among data.  As
such, some experimental has been added to export the concept of
"objects" from the database.  These objects will contain all the
information within them necessary to duplicate themselves entirely in
another CMap database.  This code is functional but still marked
"experimental" as it appears to be very slow when exporting very large
map sets.

To try this feature, choose "Export data" and then "Database objects."
Follow the directions from there.  Then try importing the data (into
another database, of course) using the "Import data" option and then
"Import CMap objects."  Database objects are only created on import at
this time;  there is no updating of existing objects, so be careful!

=head1 MAKING CORRESPONDENCES

Once you have more than one set of maps in CMap, you can use it for
what it was designed:  showing comparisons.  To do this, you must
first create the correspondences between the features on the maps.
Before you can do this, you'll need to establish the evidence types
that can be used to support the correspondences.  These are defined
in the configuration file.  For how to create evidence types, see 
L<EDITING CONFIGURATION FILES> above.

=head2 CREATING CORRESPONDENCE RECORDS

Once you have evidence types, you can create the correspondence
records.  It might be helpful to you to inspect "cmap-schema.png" and
"cmap-schema-graph.png" images in the "docs" directory that visualize
the CMap tables and their relationships.  (Also included is
"cmap-schema-desc.html," a breakdown of the tables into HTML tables
for easy viewing.)  The tables involved are:

=over 4

=item * cmap_feature

=item * cmap_feature_correspondence

=item * cmap_correspondence_lookup

=item * cmap_correspondence_evidence

=back

For descriptions of these tables, look at the "CODE_OVERVIEW.pod" document
in the "docs" directory.

There are three ways to create correspondences:

=over 4

=item 1 Create each by hand using the web admin tool.  

To do this, locate a feature on a map by:

A)  "View" a map set, then "view" a map, then "view" the feature

B)  Click on "Search for a Feature" and find the feature by name

Once you have located a feature and have navigated to the "View
Feature" page, click on the link to "Add Correspondence." This will
take you to the "Feature Correspondence Create" page where you can
search for the other feature in the relationship. When you have
located both features, you will be presented a form with the following
fields:

=over 4

=item * Evidence Type: 

The evidence type which supports this correspondence. If you wish to
add more, you can do so after creating the relationship.

=item * Acc. ID (opt.): 

The accession ID

=item * Is Enabled: 

You can hide correspondences by setting this field to "No." The
intention was that a curator could permanently negate a certain
correspondence, e.g., while running the automated name-based
comparison, a feature name "ABD104" is found on two maps so the
correspondence is created; however the curator knows that this is an
invalid correspondence, so, rather than deleted the correspondence, he
sets "Is Enabled" to "No" thereby preventing the correspondence from
being created again in the future (i.e., additional evidence types may
be added to the correspondence, but it won't be enabled -- only the
curator can re-enable a correspondence using the web admin tool).

=back

When you have finished, click the button entitled "Create
Correspondence." If the correspondence is successfully created, you
will be taken to the "View Feature Correspondence" page showing you
the two features, their respective maps and types, and the evidences
supporting this relationship. You can add more evidence types by
clicking the link "Add Evidence." You can also edit and delete
existing evidences by clicking the appropriate links to the right of
them. If you choose to "Edit" a correspondence, you will be
presented a form with the following fields:

=over 4

=item * Acc. ID (opt.): 

The accession ID.

=item * Evidence Type: 

The evidence type.

=item * Score (opt.): 

A floating-point number representing some value associated with the
correspondence, e.g., a BLAST similarity score or an e-value.

=back

=item 2 Automatic name-based correspondences

The second method for creating correspondences is to allow CMap to
create a relationship between any two features with the exact same
name, irrespective of case. To do this, start cmap_admin.pl and choose
"Make name-based correspondences."  It is recommended that you define
special evidence type to represent this automated correspondence. This
method is likely to be both incomplete and overly-optimistic. For
example, it will create correspondences between features called
"Centromere," which is probably not desirable.  The name comparisons
happen on both the "feature_name" in the "cmap_feature" table as well
as any aliases from the "cmap_feature_alias" table. Every feature has
each of these fields compared to those fields for every other feature,
so this can take a long time to complete. For all of its problems,
this can be a good way to get started, and you can pare down the
correspondences from there. 

By default, CMap will only compare features of the same type when
making name-based correspondences. You can expand the feature types
considered by adding appropriate lines to "cmap.conf." This is
documented in that file; look for the string "add_name_correspondence"
and follow the directions there.

=item 3 Import

The third way to create correspondences is to import them.
Simply create a tab-delimited file that lists the names (or accession
IDs) of two features and some evidence to support the correspondence.
For more information on the format of this file, execute the following
on your system:

  perldoc Bio::GMOD::CMap::Admin::ImportCorrespondences

This method is the surest as you are always directly controlling what
gets created.

=back

=head1 LOADING THE CORRESPONDENCE MATRIX

The data underlying the correspondence matrix is all precomputed.  As
it is an intensive operation on seldom-changing data, it was
determined to cache the pair-wise comparisons of all the maps in the
database into a (very denormalized) table that would subsequently
optimize the many calls for this data.  Because of this, it is
necessary that you remember to reload the matrix whenever you alter
the number of correspondences in the database.  To do this, execute
cmap_admin.pl and choose the "Reload correspondence matrix" option.
The only option is to completely truncate the table and reload it from
scratch.

=head1 ESTABLISHING DATABASE CROSS-REFERENCES

See the "attributes-and-xrefs.pod" document.

=head1 VIEWING DATA

Now that we've stepped through the basics of setting up the CMap data,
let's go over some of the more basic operations of curating the data.

=head2 VIEWING ALL MAP SETS

From the home page of the web admin tool, you'll see that you can
"View Map Sets."  Selecting this link takes you to the "Map Sets View"
page where you'll notice three drop-down boxes that you can use to
narrow the selection criteria for the map sets being displayed.  You
can restrict them by species, map type, and whether or not they are
currently enabled.  There is no automatic submission of the form when
you make a choice (as you might want to use more than one criteria),
so be sure to hit "Submit" when you've made your choices.  As noted
before, you can re-sort the data by clicking on the hyperlinked column
headers.  Every object in the web admin tool can be "viewed,"
"edited," and "deleted" by the respective links which are usually
displayed to the right.  

B<Note:> On pages that may return a large record set, the data is
"paged" and can be accessed by moving through the pages of the data.
On all these pages, the total number of records is displayed along
with which are currently being shown. This is the section that looks
like "52 records found. Showing 1 to 25." (The page size is determined
by the "max_child_elements" option in the CMap configuration file
which will be discussed shortly.)

=head2 VIEWING A MAP SET

Choose to "view" one of your map sets.  You'll be taken to the a page
which lists all the data in the map set table as well as a summary of
all the maps associated with the map set.  Notice that you can change
any of the data for the map set by clicking the "edit" link at the
top, or you can delete it from here by choosing the "delete" link.

B<Note:> Deleting an object that has dependencies will cause the
dependencies to be deleted as well. So deleting a map will delete all
the features (which will delete all the correspondences which will
delete all the evidences [but not evidence types] supporting the
correspondence). Deleting a map set deletes all the maps (which
deletes all the features which ... you get the picture).  Basically,
just be very sure that you want to delete something as it can have
cascading effects, and, as noted earlier, THERE IS NO UNDO. There is,
however, the option to dump your data before messing with it exists,
giving you the ability to recover. This is discussed in the POD
documentation of cmap_admin.pl.

=head2 VIEWING A MAP

Choose to "view" a map to see a summary of all the data in the map
table as well as all the features on the map.  Notice that you can
restrict the features displayed by their feature types.  You can also
search for a feature;  the search option on the map view page
automatically restricts the search to the current map being displayed.

=head2 EDITING A MAP

If you click on "Edit" while viewing a map, you will be taken to the a
page with the following fields:

=over 4

=item * Map Set: 

Shows you the map set to which the map belongs

=item * Acc ID (opt.): 

The map's accession ID.

=item * Map Name: 

The map's name.

=item * Display Order (opt.): 

The order in which to display the map in relation to the other maps in
the set.  If all the display orders are the same, then the maps will
be sorted alphabetically by their names.

=item * Start: 

The map's starting position.

=item * Stop: 

The map's stop position.

=back

=head2 VIEWING A FEATURE

Choose to "view" a feature from the map view page.  You'll be
presented with all the data stored in the feature table as well as the
feature's aliases, correspondences to other features and the evidence
types supporting the correspondences.  You can also add a new
correspondence by clicking "Add Correspondence" and following the
directions discussed earlier in section 8.

=head2 EDITING A FEATURE

If you click on the "Edit" link from the feature view page, you'll be
presented a form with the following fields:

=over 4

=item * Map: 

The map (described by "species-map set name-map name") on which the
feature occurs;  also a link to return to the overall view of that
map.

=item * Acc ID (opt.): 

The accession ID.

=item * Feature Name: 

The feature's primary name.

=item * Feature Type: 

The feature's type.

=item * Is Landmark: 

Whether or not this feature is considered a "landmark." Landmarks can
be used by the end user to show maps less dense with feature labels,
tagging only those that you as the curator have decided are the most
important.

=item * Start: 

The start position of the feature.  Must be less than the stop
position.

=item * Stop (opt.): 

The ending position of the feature, if any.

=back

=head2 SEARCHING FOR A FEATURE

Often you will be interested in finding an individual feature in the
database without having to navigate to the map set, then the map, then
page through until you find the feature.  From the home page of the
web admin tool, you can choose the "Search for a Feature" link.  The
"Feature Search" form gives you four fields:

=over 4

=item * Name: 

The strings you wish to search for.  Separate multiple search strings
with spaces or commas.

=item * Search: 

Search for the string(s) either in feature's "feature_name" (and
aliases) or "accession_id."

=item * Species (opt.): 

You can restrict by species.

=item * Feature Type (opt.): 

You can restrict by feature type the features which will be searched.

=item * Map Acc. ID (opt.): 

You can restrict the search to only those features falling on a
particular map by specifying the maps accession ID.

=back

=head1 CUSTOMIZING HTML TEMPLATES

All the HTML displayed by the application is contained in the
templates.  These templates are processed by Template Toolkit to
produce the user interface.  For the most part, the files contain
straight-up HTML and can be altered to your heart's content.  You
could probably even pass off the care and feeding of these templates
to a non-technical person (as this was the idea behind having no HTML
in the code).  The only functional parts of the templates lie in
between the many "[% %]" tags, and these are often quite
self-explanatory.  If you can't figure out what to change on your own,
then check out http://www.template-toolkit.com/ for the documentation
(or type "perldoc Template" on your command line).

=head1 ADMINISTRATION USING cmap_admin.pl 

The cmap_admin.pl script contains full documentation in POD format.  
To read, please execute "perldoc <script_name>".  However, here is a
description of the options that cmap_admin.pl provides.

=over 4

=item 1 Change current data source

Changes the data source currently being used.  This choses which 
configuration file the script will use.

=item 2 Create new map set

After a species has been created using the web admin tool, map sets 
can be created using cmap_admin.pl

=item 3 Import data

Allows import of data from files.  The files can be tab-delimited map 
data for an existing map set, tab-delimited correspondence data for 
existing features or the experimental CMap objects (which are created 
with the export function).  To see more information about the 
tab-delimited format required, see the documentation that is in the 
modules by running "perldoc /path/to/Bio/GMOD/CMap/Admin/Import.pm" 
and "perldoc /path/to/Bio/GMOD/CMap/Admin/ImportCorrespondences.pm".

=item 4 Export data

Allows export of data to a file.  The data can be represented in a
tab-delimited text file, as a series of sql insert statements or as 
the experimental CMap objects.

=item 5 Delete data

Allows sweeping deletion of maps, map sets or correspondences.

=item 6 Make name-based correspondences

Allows the creation of correspondences based on feature name 
similarities.

=item 7 Reload correspondence matrix

Reloads the lookup table that the matrix uses.  This is vital if the 
matrix is to have current data after a data change.

=item 8 Purge the cache to view new data

Purge the query cache.  The results of many queries are cached in an 
effort to reduce time querying the database for common queries.  
Purging the cache is important after the data has changed or after 
the configuration file has change.  Otherwise the changes will not 
be consistently displayed.

There are four layers of the cache.  When one layer is purged all of 
the layers after it are purged.

=over 4

=item - Cache Level 1 Purge All

Purge all when a map set or species has been added or modified.  A 
change to map sets or species has potential to impact all of the data.

=item - Cache Level 2 (purge map info on down)

Level 2 is purged when map information is changed.

=item - Cache Level 3 (purge feature info on down)

Level 3 is purged when feature information is changed.

=item - Cache Level 4 (purge correspondence info on down)

Level 3 is purged when correspondence information is changed.

=back

=item 9 Delete duplicate correspondences

If duplicate correspondences may have been added, this will remove them.

=item 10 Manage links

This option is where to import and delete links that will show up in 
the "Imported Links" section of CMap.  The import takes a tab delimited
file, see "perldoc /path/to/Bio/GMOD/CMap/Admin/ManageLinks.pm" for 
more info on the format.

Important Note:  As it is written, the links are stored in the temparary
directory '/tmp'.  When this directory is wiped, the links go away.  In future
versions of CMap this will change, but for now, you are warned.

=back

=head1 cmap_matrix_compare.pl

The cmap_matrix_compare.pl script contains full documentation in POD 
format.  To read, please execute "perldoc <script_name>".

=head1 LINKING IN

Most likely, you'll want to link directly into the CMap viewer from
some other part of your site.  Following is a list of the components
of a CMap URL:

=head2 URI

/cgi-bin/cmap/viewer?

=head2   Required Arguments: 

=over 4

=item * ref_map_set_aid: 

The accession ID of the reference map set

=item * ref_map_aids: 

The accession ID of the reference map

=back

=head2 Optional Arguments:

=over 4

=item * ref_map_start

The start position of the reference map

=item * ref_map_stop

The stop position of the reference map

=item * highlight

A space-less, comma-separated list of feature_names to highlight

=item * label_features

Which features to label, legal values are "none," "all," or "landmarks"

=item * image_size

How large to make the image, legal values are "small," "medium" or "large"

=item * font_size

How large to make the font, legal values are "small," "medium" or
"large"

=item * image_type

The output type of the image, legal value are whatever image libraries
you've installed (usually at least "png" or "jpeg" or "svg")

=item * feature_types

A space-less, comma-separated list of the accession IDs of the feature
types to display on the map

=item * evidence_types

A space-less, comma-separated list of the accession IDs of the
evidence types to use in drawing correspondence lines

=item * collapse_features

A "1" or "0" ("Yes" or "No," respectively) indicating whether to
collapse spanning features of the same type and with the same
coordinates to overlap rather than pushing out

=item * min_correspondences

The minimum number of correspondences to require between two maps

=item * comparative_maps

See below for a full discussion of how to construct this argument

=item * data_source

The "name" from the "<database>" section of "cmap.conf" identifying
the database to use.  If none is supplied, then the "<database>"
section marked "is_default 1" will be used.

=back

To link to just one map, make it the "reference" map like so by using
the accession IDs for the map's parent "set" and the map itself.
Here's an example showing just one map on Gramene, showing all the
feature labels and highlighting the feature "RM9":

  http://www.gramene.org/db/cmap/map_details?ref_map_set_aid=cu-dh-2001;ref_map_aid=cu-dh-2001-1;highlight="RM9";data_source=Gramene;label_features=all

To include some number of comparative maps, you provide them in the
"comparative_maps" argument, which is a single structured string that
lists all the comparative maps and their placement relative to the
reference map.  Here I'd like to introduce the concept of "slots,"
where the maps (or map sets) fall into a slot moving in positive and
negative direction away from the reference map, which is in slot "0,"
like so:

           -      -        -         -
           |      |        |         |
           |      |      - |  -      |
           |      |      | -  |      |
           |      |      |    |      |
           |      |      |    -      |
           -      -      -           -
          -1      0         1        2
  <----negative --+---------positive----->


The above drawing is representative of Gramene's genetic maps in slots
-1, 0, and 2, and a physical map in slot 1.  Slots are separated in
the string by URI-escaped colons and the integral parts of the slot by
URI-escaped equal signs.  Like so

    "comparative_maps="
    +
        .-  <slot_number> + 
        |  "%3D" + 
  slot  |  <"map_aid" or "map_set_aid"> + 
        |  "%3D" +
        `-  <map_aid or map_set_aid>
    +

    "%3A"

    +

   <next slot>

Here is a sample that puts "Rice-Cornell RFLP 2001-1" on the left
(slot "-1") and "Rice-CTIR 2000-1" on the right (slot "1"):

    comparative_maps=1%3Dmap_aid%3D423%3A-1%3Dmap_aid%3D1

The middle part of the slot is one of the literal strings
"map_set_aid" or "map_aid."  If you wanted to display just a single
map in a slot, use the string "map_aid" and the map's accession ID.
If you want a whole map set in a slot (e.g., a physical map set like
"I-Map"), then use the string "map_set_aid" and the map set's
accession ID.  You can use the admin interface ("/cgi-bin/cmap/admin")
to easily find the accession IDs.

=head1 USING CMAP MODULES IN CUSTOM SCRIPTS

There are several CMap modules that can be used by scripts outside 
of the cgi.  To view more documentation on module use, execute 
'perldoc Module_Name.pm".

Modules that are particularily useful:

=over 4 

=item * Bio::GMOD::CMap::Admin

Modules in the Bio::GMOD::CMap::Admin namespace deal with data 
manipulation.  There are methods in Bio::GMOD::CMap::Admin to 
create/destroy all of the CMap objects (i.e. maps, features, etc). 
Bio::GMOD::CMap::Admin::Import contains a method to import tab 
delimited files.  View the perldoc of each module in the 
Bio::GMOD::CMap::Admin namespace to find out more on how to use 
them.

=item * Bio::GMOD::CMap::Drawer

Use this module to create just the image and the image map.  This 
would be useful if you wanted to integrate a CMap image on another
page without the control stuctures.  View the perldoc for instruction
on how to use Drawer.pm.

=back

=head1 SAMPLE DATA

If you would like to see sample import data for CMap, you can find
many examples from the Gramene site:

  ftp://ftp.gramene.org/pub/gramene/maps

=head1 MISCELLANEOUS

In the "docs" directory, you will find two images that might help you
understand the relationships in the CMap tables,
"cmap-schema-graph.png" and "cmap-schema.png," both of which attempt
to describe the tables and fields and their relationships.  See also 
"cmap-schema-desc.html" for an HTML document describing the schema.
These documents were automatically generated from schema definitions
via scripts included with SQL::Translator, a set of modules which grew
out of the author's constant need to make schema changes and quickly
replicate them amongst the different test databases.  The Oracle,
PostgreSQL, SQLite and Sybase schemas were also generated by
SQL::Translator from the MySQL schema, so if you see room for
improvement, please relay them to the author, preferably via the
SQL:::Translator mailing list.  SQL::Translator is available on CPAN.
