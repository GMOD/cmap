REQUIREMENTS

There are quite a number of prerequisites to getting this running:

    * libgd (version 1.8.4, cf. http://www.boutell.com/)
    * an RDBMS (e.g., Oracle or MySQL) 
    * Perl (5.6.1 suggested)
    * Apache (version 1.3.24 or higher)
    * mod_perl (version 1.27 or higher)

For the first two requirements, you're pretty much on your own.
Installation of libgd has a number of dependencies you'll have to
resolve (e.g., zlib, JPEG libraries, etc.), and each database has its
own installation requirements you'll have to follow depending on what
you want to use.  Do note that you should not use the latest (2.0.*)
version of libgd as it causes a segfault with GD.pm.

RDBMS

Once you've settled on your database of choice and have a working
installation, you should create the tables that will hold the data for
the comparative maps.  In the "sql" directory, you will find create
scripts for Oracle and MySQL.  If you need to create scripts for a
different database, then write the author for a copy of an upcoming
(RSN) CPAN module, SQL::Translator, specifying which database you're
using.  All efforts will be made to help you convert the schema to
your system.

For MySQL, you can do the following to create the database "CMAP" and
grant appropriate permissions to a user "joe" with the password
"foobar":

    $ mysqladmin -uroot -p create CMAP
    $ mysql -uroot -p CMAP < sql/cmap.create.mysql
    $ mysql -uroot -p CMAP
    mysql> grant select, insert, update, delete \
        -> on CMAP.* to joe@localhost identified by 'foobar';

Once you've successfully created the database and chosen a username
and password for connecting, be sure to appropriately edit
CSHL::Config to reflect your connection parameters.

This application generally relies on the use of simple SQL statements
that OUGHT to run on just about any modern relational database that
implements basic joins and ANSI SQL functions like "MAX" and "MIN" and
"UPPER."  It was developed on both Oracle and MySQL, and I imagine it
should run on most other databases with minimal tweaking.  To
accomplish this, however, I've usually avoided the use of proprietary
(and perhaps performance-enhancing) extensions, such as stored
procedures and SQL dialects.  To find out more about how to customize
any problem SQL for your installation, "perldoc CSHL::CMap::Data."

Note for MySQL Users:  MySQL AB, the company which develops and
releases MySQL, offers on their website http://www.mysql.com/
commercial support for MySQL, should you desire professional help.
They also have a freely available GUI (Graphical User Interface) tool
called MySQLGUI if you are uncomfortable with the CLI (Command Line
Interface) tools.  Binaries are available for Linux, Win32, *BSD, and
Solaris. 

INSTALLING PERL & APACHE/MOD_PERL

You can install Apache and mod_perl together, but you will first need
to be sure that you have a working version of Perl.  I would highly
recommend that you compile every part of your system yourself,
starting with Perl.  Most installations of mod_perl fail because
people used RPM versions of Perl and Apache.  To get the lastest
stable version of Perl, go to the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network,
or "CPAN."  You can access it with a web browser at
"http://www.cpan.org/" or via FTP at "ftp://cpan.org."  From there,
grab "/src/stable.tar.gz," unpack the source and follow the directions
to compile Perl (usually just "sh Configure -de; make; make install"
will do it).

Once you have a proper Perl installation, you can now install Apache
and mod_perl.  You have two choices: download sources and compile by
hand or use Apache Toolbox to automate the process.

    * By Hand: Grab the latest versions of Apache and mod_perl from
      CPAN, too. FTP to "cpan.org," and grab Apache from
      "/pub/apache/dist/" and mod_perl from
      "/pub/CPAN/modules/by-module/Apache/." Unpack them into the same
      directory (e.g., "/usr/local/src/") such that the root directories
      of each package are at the same level. From there you can go into
      the mod_perl directory and compile Apache and mod_perl together in
      one step, following the directions given.

    * Apache Toolbox: Go to http://www.apachetoolbox.com/, download the
      program and follow the instructions. I've never tried this
      program, but it has gotten some decent praise in the community and
      it purports to be able to install Apache and pretty much every
      module available with it. It also claims to be able to install
      MySQL, so this might be a good program to try if you're starting
      from scratch.

INSTALLING THE PERL MODULES

To install the base modules included in this package, you can either:

1)  Execute the following commands from the current directory:

    $ perl Makefile.PL
    $ make
    # make install

    The first two commands can be run as an unprivileged user, but "make
    install" must be run as root (signified by the typical "#" prompt).

    You will be asked a couple of questions, such as where to place the
    templates and command-line scripts. You can place them in any valid
    directory on your system, but you should remember where you put them
    for configuring Apache later. There are also a number of
    "pre-requisite" modules. 

2)  Manually place the contents of "lib," "bin," and "templates" into
    directories of your choosing. Be sure to put a "use lib '...'"
    statement in your perlstartup.pl file to let Perl know where to find
    these libraries. Additionally, you'll want to place your library
    path into your PERL5LIB environment variable for when you run
    command-line programs which depend on these libraries.

If you install the cmap modules through a CPAN shell and are
prompted to install any other modules, respond in the affirmative.  If
you find that you need to install other Perl modules to satisfy
dependencies, please consider using the CPAN shell to do so as it
automates the downloading and building of modules and will recursively
install all dependencies.  To use the CPAN shell, type the following
(as root):

    # perl -MCPAN -e shell

CONFIGURING APACHE

After installing Apache, mod_perl, and all the necessary modules,
you're now ready to configure Apache.  Two files are included in the
"apache_conf" directory of this package: "httpd.conf" and
"perlstartup.pl."  These files contains all the additions you
should make to your own httpd.conf and Perl startup files.  If you
aren't already pre-loading all the Perl modules you use via a
"PerlRequire" or "PerlModule" statements, then this is a good habit to
start doing now.  :)  Simply copy the contents of these files to your
own Apache "conf" directories.

You may not need to use all the httpd.conf.  For example, you should
only include the following lines in order to set up a couple
environment variables:

    PerlSetVar TEMPLATE_DIR /usr/local/apache/templates/comparative_maps
    PerlSetVar PAGE_OBJECT  GramenePage

The first actually need not be set if you set the path in the
"CSHL::CMap::Constants" module.  The second directive will likely
never be used by anyone but the original Gramene site where the
"GramenePage" module automagically inserts proper headers and footers
and navigation bars depending on the page being requested.  If you
don't have anything like this, you can simply place your site's
headers and footers directly into the templates provided.  Probably
you can skip both of the above directives.

The application will need to write the images to a cache directory
from which Apache will serve the images.  If you do not define a
directory, then the default ("/tmp/cmap_cache") will be created for
you when you run.  However, you can specify a better choice, if you
have a preference, perhaps something in your "/var" directory or
something on a partiition separate from your web server.  If you
create a directory on your own, be sure that this directory is
writable by the httpd process (usually "web" or "nobody"), and that
the permissions on it are very restrictive.  I would suggest the
following (as root, of course):

    # mkdir /path/to/images
    # chown nobody:nobody /path/to/images 
    # chmod 700 /path/to/images 

Whether you create the cache directory or not, you will need to alias
it so that Apache will know where to find the images.  So, let's say
that you decide to put your images into "/var/web/cmap_cache" and that
you'd like to reference those images through a web browser as
"/maps/images," you'll need to add the following line to your
httpd.conf:

    Alias /maps/images /var/web/comparative_map_cache

I'd probably recommend against placing the images directly into your
DocumentRoot as the space taken by the images is completely dependent
upon the amount of traffic your site gets.  You could conceivably fill
your primary disk partition if you either never cleaned out old images
or someone launched some sort of DoS attack on you.  It would be
better to place them into a directory on a separate partition, like
"/var," which is usually able to handle such variable directories.
Where ever you put your images and however you alias them, be sure that
the "<img>" tag in the "cmap_viewer.tmpl" template reflects the same
path as your Alias.

The map images will only be used for one request, so you'll need to
include some way to clear out old images.  A simple cron job will do
the trick.  Add this to your root crontab (e.g., by running "crontab
-e" as root):

    0 0 * * *  find /var/web/comparative_map_cache/ \
        -type f -mtime +1 -exec rm -rf {} \;

INSTALLING MOD_PERL HANDLERS

To make the comparative map code "live," you'll have to tell Apache to
execute the code when a user goes to a particular location.  You do
this by adding the following directives to the httpd.conf:

    <Location /cmap/admin>
        AuthType        Basic
        AuthName        "Maps Curation"
        AuthUserFile    /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords
        Require         valid-user
        SetHandler      perl-script
        PerlHandler     CSHL::CMap::Apache::AdminViewer
    </Location>

    <Location /cmap/feature>
        SetHandler      perl-script
        PerlHandler     CSHL::CMap::Apache::FeatureViewer->super
    </Location>

    <Location /cmap/feature_search>
        SetHandler      perl-script
        PerlHandler     CSHL::CMap::Apache::FeatureSearch->super
    </Location> 

    <Location /cmap/help>
        SetHandler      perl-script
        PerlHandler     CSHL::CMap::Apache::HelpViewer->super
    </Location>

    <Location /cmap/map_set_info>
        SetHandler      perl-script
        PerlHandler     CSHL::CMap::Apache::MapSetViewer->super
    </Location>

    <Location /cmap/matrix>
        SetHandler      perl-script
        PerlHandler     CSHL::CMap::Apache::MatrixViewer->super
    </Location>

    <Location /cmap/viewer>
        PerlInitHandler CSHL::CMap::Apache::UserPreferences
        SetHandler      perl-script
        PerlHandler     CSHL::CMap::Apache::MapViewer->super
    </Location>

perlstartup.pl

To take full advantage of the performance benefits of mod_perl, you'll
want to create a file containing all the modules that Apache will use
in its lifetime.  Typically, this file is called something like
"perlstartup.pl" and is placed in the same directory as the
httpd.conf.  The parent Apache process will parse this file and
include all the modules in each child process, further enhancing the
performance of the application.

NOTE:  Everything in Apache's "conf" directory is very important
and sensitive, so it's best to have everything be owned and writable
only by root.  The startup file will be executed as root, so this
could represent an easy root compromise were a non-root user able to
write to the file.  With this in mind, as root, create this file with
the following lines:

    # File: perlstartup.pl
    use Apache();
    use Apache::Constants();
    use Apache::Cookie();
    use Apache::Reload();
    use Apache::Request();
    use Class::Base();
    use Data::Dumper();
    use DBI();
    use DBD::mysql();   
    use Error();
    use GD();
    use File::MkTemp;
    use Template();

    use CSHL::Config();
    use CSHL::CMap();
    use CSHL::CMap::Admin();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::UserPreferences();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::AdminViewer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::HelpViewer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::FeatureSearch();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::FeatureViewer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::MapViewer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::MapSetViewer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::MatrixViewer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Apache::RelationalMapViewer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Constants();
    use CSHL::CMap::Data();
    use CSHL::CMap::Data::Generic();
    use CSHL::CMap::Data::MySQL();
    use CSHL::CMap::Data::Oracle();
    use CSHL::CMap::Drawer();
    use CSHL::CMap::Drawer::Map();
    use CSHL::CMap::Drawer::Feature();
    use CSHL::CMap::Utils();

    1;

Now you'll want to add this line to your httpd.conf to tell Apache to
load all those modules at start time:

    PerlRequire      /path/to/perlstartup.pl

Where "/path/to/perlstartup.pl" would probably be something like
"/usr/local/apache/conf/perlstartup.pl."

Now see if Apache like what you've done by typing the following
command (you'll probably have to specify a full path to "apachectl"):

    # apachectl configtest

If everything is OK, then restart Apache:

    # apachectl stop
    # apachectl start

IMPORTING YOUR DATA

Now you've got some basic setup to do for your data.  First off, open
up the web administration interface by going to the URL you set up for
the CSHL::CMap::AdminViewer module.  You'll need to set up what types
of maps, features, species, and evidence types you'll be working with.
For each, go to the "View ..." choice from the main menu, then choose
"Create New ..." and fill in the correct information.  For information
on the correct format for data import, "perldoc
CSHL::CMap::Admin::Import." When you have your data in the correct
format, launch the "cmap_admin.pl" script and follow the instructions.

When setting up database cross-references, you'll have to use some
extra syntax in the URL field to indicate the field to link out on.
Here's an example from Gramene for linking to GrainGenes:

    http://www.graingenes.org/cgi-bin/WebAce/webace?\
    db=graingenes&class=Locus&object=[% feature.feature_name %]

And here's how we link to our own contig viewer:

    /perl/contigview?clone=[% feature.feature_name %]

The funny brackets ("[%" and "%]") are from Template Toolkit, the
templating system used for the comparative maps.  Simply use whichever
field you want from the feature table (accession_id, feature_name, or
alternate_name) and the above style syntax for either absolute (first)
or relative (second) URLs.

For now, the only correspondences supported are name-based, so run the
"Find name-based correspondences" command from cmap_admin.pl.  Make
sure that you've created some evidence type to represent this
automated correspondence.  If you don't run this, then there will be
no relationships among your maps.  If you run this and don't have
like-named features on different maps, then you'll have to create the
correspondences yourself using the admin tool.  I'll write a tool for
importing some sort of correspondence data RSN.  Suggestions on the
format of the data would be welcomed.

CUSTOMIZING YOUR INSTALLATION

You should edit CSHL::CMap::Constants to reflect your own preferences.
Remember to restart Apache whenever you make a change to this file as
these are *constants* and therefore don't change for the life of the
Apache process.  You can also change the way maps and features are
drawn based on their types.  Edit each "map type" and "feature type"
that you create, and experiment with the colors, shapes, and sizes
available to you.

CUSTOMIZING YOUR HTML

All the HTML displayed by the application is contained in the
templates.  These templates are processed by Template Toolkit to
produce the user interface.  For the most part, the files contain
straight-up HTML and can be altered to your heart's content.  You
could probably even pass off the care and feeding of these templates
to a non-technical person (as this was the idea behind having no HTML
in the code).  The only functional parts of the templates lie in
between the many "[% %]" tags, and these are often quite
self-explanatory.  If you can't figure out what to change on your own,
then check out http://www.template-toolkit.com/ for the documentation
(or type "perldoc Template" on your command line).
