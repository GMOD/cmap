=head1 Introduction

I'm glad you've decided to synchronize your Chado data with CMap.  This
document will help you get started

=head1 Postgres Requirements

Postgres 8.0+ with Perl support is required to use the Perl triggers.  You will need to upgrade your install of Postgres if your version does not meet the requirements.

=head2 Upgrading Postgres

When upgrading, first see the upgrade secion of postgres INSTALL doc.  

Here is what I had to do:

=over 4

=item - Dumped old posgres db

  $ pg_dumpall > outputfile
=item - kill current posgres

=item - Install Postgres 8.0+ with Perl

use the  --with-perl flag during config

  $ ./configure --with-perl
  $ make
  $ make install
  $ su - postgres
  $ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
  $ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l /usr/local/pgsql/logfile start

=item - Add the old data back 

  $ /usr/local/pgsql/bin/psql -d postgres -f outputfile

=head1 Add "untrusted" perl to the db
  $ createlang plperlu template1
  $ createlang plperlu dbname

=back

=head1 Add new tables to chado.  
 
These tables give the concept of a feature set (featureset) and links it to
feature (feature_featureset) and dbxref (featureset_dbxref).  It also adds a
linker table from featureloc to dbxref (featureloc_dbxref).

    $ psql test2 < chado_integration/chado_synchronize/chado_sync_tables.sql

=head1 Create featureset. 

In order for this whole thing to work, the featureset table needs to be
populated.  Someday, a script might help you out with this but for now you will
have to do this by hand.

The concept of a featureset is the same as a map set in CMap.  Basically, maps
(sequence assemblies, chromosomes or whatever you want to make a map) are
grouped into sets.  For example, sequence assembies from the same assembly run
would all be in the same set to differenciate from other assembly runs.  

=head2 featureset constraints

All maps in a set must be of the same type.

All maps in a set must be from the same organism. 

Maps must only belong to one featureset otherwise there will possibly be
inconsistencies.

=head2 Example populating featureset:

 insert into featureset (name,uniquename,feature_type_id,organism_id) 
  (
    select distinct 
        o.abbreviation||'_'||cvt.name,
        o.abbreviation||'_'||cvt.name,
        f.type_id,
        f.organism_id
    from feature f, organism o, cvterm cvt 
    where   f.type_id = cvt.cvterm_id
        and f.organism_id = o.organism_id
        and cvt.name = 'chromosome_arm'
  );

=head1 Add "maps" into featureset. 

Each "map" is connected to it's featureset by feature_featureset.

=head2 Example populating feature_featureset

This example is not very complex.  For instance it does not take into account
various versions of data but you can use it as a starting point.

  insert into feature_featureset 
    select fs.featureset_id, f.feature_id 
    from featureset fs, feature f 
    where f.type_id = fs.feature_type_id;

=head1 Insert new CMap map_types and feature_types

You will need to insert new map types and feature types into the CMap config
file.  The accessions for these types should be the cvterm "name" but with
spaces replaced by "_".

=head1 Run cmap_syncronize_chado.pl

This script will look at the featuresets that you've inserted and insert the
data into CMap.  

You will have several options.  The most import is the feature types to look
at.  If you select too many, it may take a long time.

  $ chado_integration/chado_synchronize/cmap_syncronize_chado.pl --chado_datasource datasource -u sql_username [-p sql_password] --cmap_datasource cmap_datasource

=head1 Create Correspondences

You will now need to use cmap_admin.pm to create correspondences between the
newly created features.

=head1 Future stuff

In the relatively near future, there will be triggers to install that will
update CMap everytime chado is updated.
