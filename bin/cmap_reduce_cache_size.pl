cmap_reduce_cache_size.pl - Limit the size of the query caches

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  cmap_reduce_cache_size.pl

This script will reduce the size of the query caches to the size given in the
config file as 'max_query_cache_size'.

No Options

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script cycles through each CMap data_source and (using the
Cache::SizeAwareFileCache functionality) reduces the size of the query cache to
the value given as 'max_query_cache_size' in the config file.  

It first removes any expired entries and then if it is still over the limit, it
moves to last accessed entries.

If 'max_query_cache_size' is not set, it will use the default value in
Bio::GMOD::CMap::Constants.

It is suggested that this script is run periodically as a cron job.
