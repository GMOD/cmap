                            Known Bugs in CMap

                              $Revision: 1.1 $

-   When relational maps have feature shapse that aren't directly on
    the map (like dumbells, I-beams, etc.), they collide with the map
    title which is written vertically beside the map.  Either I need to
    move the title to a horizontal position above the map (which will
    make it like all the other maps) or I need to delay writing the title
    until after drawing all the features.
-   There seems to be a problem with the matrix and PostgreSQL
-   As more features float beside a map, they are colliding with
    labels.  Most likely the features will need to be drawn first,
    then labels will be floated out beyond the furthest feature glyph.
