Each cell in the matrix shows the number of correspondences (and maps)
between each pair.  A correspondence is any relationship between
two features.

#
# When making name-based correspondences, the default behavior is to
# allow correspondences between features of the *exact* same type.  If
# you wish to expand the feature types allowed when making name-based
# correspondences, then add their accession IDs to this section.  The
# relationships will be reciprocal, so if you say "foo bar" then
# correspondences from features with the accession ID "foo" will be
# allowed to those with the accession ID "bar" and vice versa.
# Separate feature types with spaces.  Assert all equivalent feature
# types on one line, e.g., "foo bar baz."
# Default: Nothing
#
#add_name_correspondence foo bar baz
#add_name_correspondence fee fie

# Any entries to "disallow_name_correspondence" will cause the admin
# tool to NOT make correspondences between features of the types listed.
# Either list the feature type accessions separated by spaces on one

# disallow_name_correspondence centromere qtl

# Drawing information for Feature type

#Notice the area_code, required_page_code and extra_forms
#  The area_code is perl code that will be used to create the javascript
#    for features/maps being described.  It will be inserted in the area map
#    over the object.  $code is a variable that holds the javascript, so
#    append all new code to the $code variable.  Some of the variables
#    from the underlying CMap code are accessable to this code.
#
#  The required_page_code lists the names of required page_code (described
#    later) needed to perform the tasks in area_code.  The page_code is 
#    added to the top of the page and is most likely going to be functions
#    to be called.
#
#  The extra_forms contains the names of extra_forms (described later)
#    which contain extra form elements.  This is so the admin can add
#    text fields, buttons, etc.
