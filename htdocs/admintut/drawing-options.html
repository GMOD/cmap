      When creating links to CMap, you can set a number of options to
      control how the data is displayed. To illustrate each option, a
      summary and its affect on the image follows.

      Here is the starting image:

      the map will be used.  The map to the right was restricted with
      an argument of &quot;20&quot; for the start of the reference map.

      A comma- or space-delimited string of features to highlight on the
      maps. You can provide either the feature's primary name, alternate
      name, or accession ID. If you wish to use a name with an embedded
      space, then enclose the name in double quotes. In the image, the
      two features were highlighted using an accession ID and a
      feature name.

<b>Reference Map:</b>
Recall that the <em>reference map</em> is considered the <em>central,
starting map</em> from which all subsequent comparisons are made.
It's not necessarily in the <em>center</em> of the view, however, as
all the comparative maps could easily extend solely to the right or
left of the reference map.  The reference map is simply the first map
that a user starts with in building comparative map views.
