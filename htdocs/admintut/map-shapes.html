<p>
A map's appearance is primarily determined by its map type; however,
this can be overridden at the map set level.  The idea is that the
user should be able to determine the type of map (e.g., genetic,
cytogentic, physical, etc.) from the color and shape, but the curator
should be allowed to make some maps visually distinctive from others
of the same type.
</p>

<p>
Following are the attributes that you can assign to either a <b>map
type</b> or a <b>map set</b> (via their respective <em>edit</em> pages
in the CMap web admin tool) to alter how the map will appear:
</p>

<h2>Shape</h2>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th width="33%">Box</th>
    <th width="33%">Dumbbell</th>
    <th width="33%">I-beam</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top">
      As the name suggests, this is a box that is filled with the color of
      your choice and trimmed in black.
      Here is an example of a map with the &quot;box&quot; shape:
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      Here is the same map displayed as a dumbbell.
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
      And here is the map as an I-beam.  The feature line at the top
      obscures the cross bar there, but the bottom one is visible.
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/shape-box.jpg">
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/shape-dumbbell.jpg">
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/shape-ibeam.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Color</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="25%">
      You can choose from 140 colors from the pop-up menu on the edit
      pages for the map type or map set. Because the &quot;box&quot;
      shape is trimmed in black, you can use a light color, but the
      &quot;dummbell&quot; and &quot;I-beam&quot; really need darker
      colors to stand out against the background. It's wise not to
      choose a color too dark for the box, however, or you won't be able
      to see very well those features drawn as a &quot;line,&quot; e.g.:
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="images/shape-too-dark.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Width</h2>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      You can specify the width of a map from 1-10 pixels.  If you choose
      nothing, a reasonable default will be used.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Here's a dumbbell with a width of &quot;1&quot; in
      &quot;darkblue.&quot;
    </td>
    <td>
      And here it is with a width of &quot;10&quot; in
      &quot;cornflowerblue.&quot;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/shape-skinny-db.jpg">
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/shape-fat-db.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Here's that map as a box with a width of &quot;4&quot; in
      &quot;lightblue.&quot;
    </td>
    <td>
      And here it is with a width of &quot;10&quot; in &quot;lime.&quot;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/shape-skinny-box.jpg">
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/shape-fat-box.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
