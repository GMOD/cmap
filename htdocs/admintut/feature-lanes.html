In addition to determing the glyph and color for feature types, you
can control how features are grouped, how they are placed in proximity
to the map, and the order in which they are drawn.  This grouping
(into &quot;lanes&quot;) and ordering (via &quot;priorities&quot;)
allows the curator to prioritize data so that the end user can better
discern patterns.

<h2>Lane</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">
      By default, all the features for a map are drawn as closely to the map
      as possible.  Here's an example of a rather dense map with all the
      features in the same lane (and at the same priority):
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">
      Here it is with the &quot;lines&quot; and &quot;box&quot; in the
      lane &quot;1&quot;, and the rest in lane &quot;2.&quot;
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">
      And here it is with the each feature type in it's own lane (with
      the exception of the &quot;box,&quot; which shares the same lane as
      the &quot;line.&quot;
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-cluttered.jpg">
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-uncluttered1.jpg">
    </td>
    <td valign="center" align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-uncluttered2.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The idea of &quot;lanes&quot; is not absolute.  Assigning a feature
type to lane &quot;5&quot; does not mean that there will be empty
lanes if features for lanes 2-4 are missing -- the missing lanes will
simply be skipped.  The numbers you assign to the &quot;lane&quot;
value are used to group features into the same drawing area and to
order which are drawn closer to the map.
</p>

<h2>Priority</h2>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">
      The &quot;priority&quot; value is used to determine how soon to
      drawn a feature <em>within its assigned lane</em>. Here the
      features are drawn at the same priority. Notice how they
      mix:
    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">
      Here the features are drawn at the same priority. The blue
      triangles are given a higher priority than the brown dumbbells,
      causing them all to be drawn first.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-eq-priority.jpg">
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/lanes-with-priority.jpg">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
