<p>
You can set up many CMap databases (each running on a different
RDBMS!) and simply point CMap to each of them.  This is especially
helpful if you would like to maintain spaces for testing, staging,
and production.
</p>

<p>
The default &quot;cmap.conf&quot; file shows how to define more than
one datasource and describes each setting of the
<code>&lt;database&gt;</code> section.  If you only wish to have one
database connection defined, simply delete the lines for the one you
don't want or comment it out by placing hash signs at the beginning of
the lines.
</p>

<p>
When you have more than one datasource defined, you should
automatically see a "Data Source" menu in the upper-right corner of
the CMap pages (and in the top-center on the admin home page).  This
will allow users to switch between different databases, each of which
is completely independent from the others.
